I'm Steven—a software architect with 15+ years building cloud-native platforms and distributed systems.

I share practical insights on system design, architectural patterns, and modern development practices. Learn from real projects: migrating monoliths to microservices, optimizing AWS infrastructure, implementing Domain-Driven Design, and leading engineering teams.

Whether you're a developer leveling up to architect or a team building production systems, you'll find actionable strategies backed by real-world experience.
