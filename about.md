## Hi

I'm a software architect who believes great systems aren't just about elegant code—they're about solving real problems for real people. Over the past 15+ years, I've built everything from distributed microservices and cloud-native platforms to automation tools and point-of-sale systems, all while keeping one eye on scalability and the other on the bottom line.

### What I Do

I spend my days designing cloud architectures that scale gracefully, mentoring developers on clean code principles, and helping teams navigate the tricky balance between velocity and stability. Whether it's cutting infrastructure costs by 80%, implementing zero-trust security models, or building event-driven systems that handle millions of transactions, I'm all about creating software that works beautifully under pressure.

My sweet spot is AWS-based solutions with .NET at the core, but I'm no stranger to GraphQL APIs, Vue.js frontends, serverless architectures, and the entire DevOps toolchain. I've worked across financial services, digital banking, and SaaS, which means I've learned to speak both engineer and business fluently.

### My Philosophy

Good architecture isn't about using the fanciest tech—it's about making thoughtful tradeoffs. I believe in:

- **Building for tomorrow, not just today**: Architectures should evolve with your business, not against it
- **Security and performance as first-class citizens**: No shortcuts when it comes to protecting data or delivering speed
- **Empowering teams**: The best systems are built by empowered developers who understand the "why" behind decisions
- **Pragmatic solutions**: Sometimes the boring technology is exactly what you need

### This Blog

This site is where I unpack what I've learned about software architecture, cloud systems, and the art of building things that last. You'll find:

- Deep dives into system design patterns and architectural tradeoffs
- Real-world lessons from modernizing legacy systems and building greenfield platforms
- Practical guides on AWS, .NET, microservices, and DevOps practices
- Musings on engineering leadership, mentorship, and keeping teams productive

I write for the developer who's curious about the bigger picture—how individual pieces fit together to create systems that are reliable, secure, and actually enjoyable to work on.

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems or debugging production mysteries, I'm probably exploring new technologies, tinkering with side projects, or sharing what I've learned with other engineers. I believe the best way to grow as a developer is to stay curious and keep building.

### Let's Connect

I love talking shop with fellow engineers, architects, and anyone passionate about building great software. Whether you want to discuss cloud architectures, swap war stories about legacy migrations, or just say hello—I'm always up for a good conversation.
