Blazor offers a solid development experience—C# for web UIs with full JavaScript interop when needed. But Microsoft's UI framework graveyard raises an obvious question: Is this different, or are we repeating history?

## Microsoft's UI Framework Graveyard

- **Web Forms** — Hide HTML complexity (abandoned)
- **WPF** — The desktop future (niche)
- **Silverlight** — (we don't talk about it)
- **Universal Apps** — Run everywhere (dead)
- **MAUI** — Unify mobile/desktop (struggling)

Each promised cross-platform simplicity. Each followed the same trajectory.

## What's Different This Time?

**Humility.** Blazor's pitch is simply "C# for web UIs"—no grand promises, no "write once, run everywhere" hype.

Microsoft learned from TypeScript and is running dual strategies:
- **TypeScript** — Improve JavaScript for everyone
- **Blazor** — WebAssembly option for .NET teams

**Adoption reality:** ~40k websites (growing 200%+ but still tiny). Mostly enterprise internal apps. Even Microsoft doesn't use Blazor for flagship properties.

**The real strategy:** This isn't about replacing JavaScript. It's positioning for when performance-critical web apps need WebAssembly—AI interfaces, data visualization, browser-based tools. Let JavaScript dominate today; be ready for tomorrow's performance tier.

## Decision Framework

**Use Blazor if:**
- .NET-heavy organization needing internal tools
- Performance-critical web computations (data processing, visualizations)
- Betting on WebAssembly's future for AI/computational interfaces

**Stick with TypeScript/JavaScript if:**
- Web-first organization
- Need broad ecosystem and hiring pool
- Building standard web applications

## Will It Survive?

**The uncertainty:** Microsoft's track record speaks for itself. Decades of abandoned UI frameworks create justified skepticism.

**The difference:** WebAssembly isn't Microsoft-specific. Even if Microsoft abandons Blazor, the compiled output remains usable. That's more durability than previous frameworks offered—but still not a guarantee.

**The reality:** Users need performance, not specific technologies. WebAssembly adoption depends on whether the web demands it. AI interfaces and browser-based tools might drive that demand. Or they might not.

## The Verdict

Use Blazor where it delivers clear value today. Don't architect long-term systems assuming it will be supported forever.

Microsoft stopped fighting the web and started complementing it—that's progress. Whether Blazor is a hedge bet or another experiment remains to be seen.
