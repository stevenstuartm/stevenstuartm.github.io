After gaining experience with .NET Blazor, I'm left with big picture questions.

I like the Blazor development experience. It doesn't prevent you from doing anything critical in JS; it starts you with a .NET wrapper and ecosystem and lets you build stable products quickly. But where is this going? Haven't we seen this before?

## The Pattern

Web Forms promised to hide HTML complexity (abandoned). WPF was the future of desktop (niche). Universal Apps would run everywhere (dead). MAUI would unify mobile/desktop (struggling). Each promised to simplify cross-platform development. Let's not even talk about Silverlight.

## What's Different This Time?

Microsoft's official Blazor pitch is remarkably humble—just "C# for web UIs" with zero grand promises. No "write once, run everywhere" hype.

Microsoft learned from TypeScript's success and is running dual plays:
- **TypeScript:** Make JavaScript better
- **Blazor:** Provide WebAssembly alternative for .NET teams

Who's using Blazor? 40k websites (growing 200%+ but still tiny). Mostly enterprise internal apps. Even Microsoft doesn't use it for flagship web properties.

This isn't about replacing JavaScript. It's Microsoft positioning for when performance-critical web apps need WebAssembly. They may be playing the long game while letting JavaScript dominate today.

## What This Actually Means

- **If you're .NET-heavy:** Blazor currently makes sense for specific internal and computational scenarios
- **If you're web-first:** TypeScript is their real gift to you
- **If you believe AI/gaming will drive WebAssembly adoption:** Blazor positions you early

Microsoft finally stopped fighting the web and started complementing it. Blazor might not be just another experiment—but a hedge bet on the performance tier of tomorrow's web.

## But Do We Have Evidence Blazor Will Survive?

It depends on what people need. People need faster UX; they don't care how we got them there. So what's the motivation for dev teams to introduce WebAssembly apps or portions of apps?

WebAssembly does prevent the tech from becoming unusable even if MS stops supporting it, but that's not much comfort.

Microsoft's UI framework graveyard spans decades. The pattern is too consistent to ignore.

## The Verdict

Use Blazor where it adds value. But don't bet on it lasting forever.
