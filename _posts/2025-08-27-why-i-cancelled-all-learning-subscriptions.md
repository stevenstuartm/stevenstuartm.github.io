title: "Why I Cancelled All My Learning Subscriptions"

After years of collecting digital course subscriptions like Pokemon cards, I finally hit unsubscribe on all of them. Because learning is bad? No. Because deliverables will always trump "learning".

Learning platforms sell you the illusion of progress. That green completion badge feels good, but can you actually build something without the training wheels? There is a more time efficient way to go from "zero to hero". You will learn stuff from these platforms, but you will not retain it and will have wasted too much time gaining very little.

## The Problem with Platforms

**Interactive Platforms:** Sure, you're "coding," but in a sanitized playground. No dealing with dependency conflicts, environment setup, or the beautiful chaos of real development. You're learning to code in a bubble that doesn't exist in the real world.

**Video Platforms:** Passive consumption â‰  learning. Watching someone else code is like learning to swim by watching Olympic diving competitions. Plus, most content is outdated before you finish the course.

## What Actually Works

**Build real projects** - Even terrible ones teach you more than perfect tutorials. That broken todo app you're embarrassed about? It taught you more about state management than 10 hours of videos.

**Use official docs** - Framework creators know their tools better than course instructors. Most modern documentation is excellent.

**GitHub** - Thousands of real-world projects, starter templates, and examples. Sure, there is some junk there, but filtering nonsense is a daily norm for devs.

**AI as your rubber duck** - Got stuck? A quick chat can unstick you faster than scrolling through course forums from 2019.

## Real Learning Happens When

- You break something and have to fix it
- You read error messages until they make sense
- You copy-paste code and then figure out why it works
- You ship something that people actually use
