We've innovated incredible technologies: Rust's memory safety, modern type systems, superior runtimes. On paper, we have objectively better tools than what runs most production systems.

But can we afford to adopt them? The switching cost trap may leave optimal technologies unused while we maintain legacy systems indefinitely.

## The Timing Problem

The startup boom funded experimentation. But now? The economic conditions shifted just as these technologies matured. The result? Two increasingly separate worlds: Enthusiasts pushing boundaries and "real-world" developers maintaining "good enough" legacy code.

We're spending massive engineering effort building migration bridges instead of actually migrating. Each compatibility layer, transpiler, and interop tool represents opportunity cost; energy that could advance the field instead maintains the status quo.

## The Switching Cost Trap

The switching cost trap is real. Every year without adoption makes migration more expensive and the business case weaker. We're potentially facing decades where optimal tech remains unused while we maintain increasingly fragile systems.

Historically, major tech transitions often needed (or were certainly aided by) external forces: Y2K, security crises, regulatory pressure. Without that catalyst, do we just... stay stuck?

## The Question

Are we headed for technical stagnation, or do you see a path forward that doesn't require a crisis to drive change?
