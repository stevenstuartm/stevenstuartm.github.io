Effective technical leaders and mentors share distinct characteristics that separate them from individual contributors. Here are the questions that reveal true leadership.

## 1. Do You Accumulate Experience or Repeat It?

**Repeating:** Doing the same work year after year, measuring tenure not growth.

**Accumulating:** Building new capabilities, taking on broader responsibilities, establishing feedback loops for yourself and your team.

**Leaders are builders**—they create opportunities for others while advancing their own skills. Even when focused on code, they enable team growth.

## 2. "It Works" vs. "Is This Good?"

Everyone starts with "it works because it's not broken." Juniors stay there. Seniors evolve.

**Key distinction:** Taking accountability for code quality *after* deployment. Leaders continuously ask "Is this good?" even when everything seems fine. They seek questions they don't yet know to ask.

Quality isn't the absence of complaints—it's the presence of standards.

## 3. Quality Approves vs. Approval Is Quality

Just because no one flagged your code doesn't mean it's quality work. Just because it shipped doesn't mean it's right.

**Leaders maintain standards independent of external validation.** They critique their own work, seek improvement opportunities, and build systems that reward quality over mere completion.

## 4. Do You Build Others to Build Better Products?

This is foundational. **We learn by teaching.**

Are you mentoring less experienced engineers to do what you do? Not as a nice-to-have, but as core responsibility? This creates space for your own growth—as they take your current work, you tackle what your leaders do.

**Leadership multiplier:** Great engineers solve hard problems. Great leaders create engineers who solve hard problems.

## The Bottom Line

Leadership in software development isn't about titles—it's about:
- Continuous growth over comfortable repetition
- Quality standards over "it works"
- Building others as you build systems
- Accountability that extends beyond deployment

These characteristics compound over careers, creating engineers who don't just write code—they elevate teams and organizations.
