What characteristics do we see that define the leaders and mentors in our software development teams?

## Do We Accumulate Experience or Merely Repeat It?

Do we limit our perspective to simply keeping a job (although surviving can sometimes be praiseworthy in itself) or do we also aspire to be a builder? A builder tends to create jobs and makes builders of others even when their primary intended focus is innovating code. Do we have a personal objective feedback loop for ourselves as well as our team?

## Do We Continuously Ask "Is This Good?" or Rather State "This Is Good Because It Works"?

We ALL go through the "it works because it is not broken" phase when we first begin to code. Never stop searching for the question we do not yet know to ask. Do we eagerly take accountability for our work even after it is deployed and "working"?

## "Quality Approves" Versus "Approval Is Quality"

Even if everything seems to be going well, that does not mean that what we are doing is correct. Even if no one has told us that our code or design stinks, that does not mean that we have produced quality.

## Are We Accountable Enough to Build Each Other in Order to Build Better Products?

This is the foundation of the other questions. We learn when we teach. Are we slowly mentoring those in less experienced roles to do what we do so that we can move forward and do what our leaders do?
