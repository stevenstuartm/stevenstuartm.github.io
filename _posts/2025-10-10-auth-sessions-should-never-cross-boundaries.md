It is tempting to treat user authentication sessions as ambient context, passing them through API layers, into service calls, across event processors, and through background jobs. The assumption: if a component needs to know who the user is, it needs the user's session. This conflates authentication with context, treating an external trust artifact as internal state. The result is coupling, performance waste, and systems that fundamentally break in asynchronous, event-driven, and integration scenarios.

## Sessions Validate at Boundaries, Context Flows Internally

Authentication sessions serve one purpose: validating identity at a security boundary. Once validated, the session should be consumed and replaced with explicit context and service credentials.

The pattern:

1. **User session arrives at the boundary** (API endpoint, gateway, edge function)
2. **Boundary validates the session**: Confirm identity, extract user context
3. **Session is consumed**: Extract only the necessary context (user_id, tenant_id, correlation_id, relevant metadata)
4. **Internal operations use service roles**: Components operate with service credentials (database connections, API keys, queue permissions)
5. **User context is passed explicitly**: As structured data, not as the original session token

The session's job ends at the boundary. Everything beyond that point operates within your system's trust domain using service-level credentials and explicit context propagation.

## Why Sessions Don't Belong in Internal Flows

**Sessions are external trust artifacts.** A user session token represents authentication with an external identity provider or your auth system. It's proof that someone outside your system is who they claim to be. Once verified at your boundary, propagating it further treats authentication as global state rather than a specific validation event.

**Repeated validation is wasteful.** Every component that receives a user session must validate it: verify cryptographic signatures, check expiration, potentially query the auth provider. If your request flows through multiple services or processors, you're performing this validation repeatedly for a single user action.

**Coupling to external authentication.** When internal components accept user sessions, they become coupled to the token format, the issuer's validation requirements, token refresh logic, and external auth provider availability. Changing auth providers or migrating token formats requires updating every component that parses sessions.

## Problems and Solutions

When you propagate user sessions through internal components, common failure patterns emerge regardless of your architecture:

**Session expiration mid-flow**: Event processors run minutes later—session expired. Background jobs run hours later—session gone. Async processors retry—session invalid. You build workarounds: token refresh in queues, session persistence in metadata, "system sessions" for background work.

**Missing sessions entirely**: Scheduled reports run at 3 AM—no user logged in. Webhooks arrive from Stripe—no user session. System maintenance tasks—no user context. You duplicate logic: one path for user requests, one for non-user operations.

**Context across time and actors**: Multi-step workflows span hours. Original user's session expires. Different actors have different sessions. Background processors have none. The workflow breaks without explicit context that persists.

**The Solution:** Boundaries validate external trust artifacts and convert them to internal context. The API Gateway validates the user session, extracts explicit context (user_id, tenant_id, correlation_id), and passes it forward—not the session. Each component uses service credentials (database connections, API keys, queue permissions) for technical capability and performs explicit authorization checks using the context. This works identically whether triggered by user requests, webhooks, scheduled jobs, or system events.

## Common Objections

### "We Lose User Context for Auditing"

No, you lose the session token, not the user context. Proper auditing requires intentional context capture: user_id, tenant_id, correlation_id, source_ip, user_agent, timestamp.

This context flows explicitly through every component. Relying on session tokens for auditing is worse: sessions don't persist for audit trails, you're logging authentication artifacts instead of business context, and different components might parse tokens differently.

**Intentional data flow is the point.** If you need user_id in audit logs, require it as an explicit parameter. This forces you to think about what context crosses boundaries and prevents accidental omissions.

### "Compliance Requires User Identity Throughout the System"

Compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR) require knowing **who** performed an action and **when**. User sessions are for authentication—proving identity at the boundary. Passing user_id in explicit context satisfies compliance. Passing the session token does not improve compliance—it couples your compliance logging to your auth mechanism.

### "Service Roles Create Privilege Escalation Risks"

This assumes your service role can do things it shouldn't based on improper input validation or authorization bypasses. But that's a security bug, not a pattern problem.

Service roles provide technical capability (database access, API credentials). Business logic enforces authorization (grant checks, tenant isolation, permission verification). This authorization check is necessary whether you use service roles or propagate user sessions.

Service roles make this clearer: the service has technical capability but requires explicit business authorization. User sessions blur this distinction by suggesting the session itself grants permission.

### "We Need Sessions for Distributed Tracing"

No, you need correlation IDs for distributed tracing, not session tokens.

Distributed systems require explicit tracing infrastructure: correlation_id, trace_id, span_id, timestamps. This works for all request types: user requests, background jobs, webhooks, internal system tasks, lambda invocations, event processors.

If you rely on session tokens for tracing, non-user-initiated requests fail. Correlation IDs are the intentional, universal solution.

### "We're Using a Monolith, This Doesn't Apply"

Using a monolith does not exempt you from these principles. You still must avoid global user session context and pass user context within structures appropriate to the needs of each module.

Treating the session as globally accessible state makes distribution impossible when you eventually need to scale. It makes unit testing a nightmare—every test requires mocking session context. It couples your service layer to your web layer, preventing reuse from background jobs, CLI tools, or internal scripts.

The same principles apply: modules accept explicit context, operate with their own credentials, and perform explicit authorization. Whether those modules are in separate processes or the same codebase is irrelevant to the design.

## Conclusion

User authentication sessions serve one purpose: validating identity at a security boundary. Once validated, the session has done its job. Extract the necessary context, discard the session, and operate with service roles internally.

The alternative—propagating sessions through internal flows—treats authentication as global state, couples components to auth mechanisms, wastes resources on redundant validation, and fundamentally breaks in event-driven architectures, background jobs, approval workflows, webhook integrations, and async processing.

This isn't about microservices vs. monoliths. It's about recognizing architectural boundaries and respecting them:

- **Explicit over implicit**: Pass the context you need, not the artifact you don't
- **Decoupling over convenience**: Components shouldn't depend on external auth formats
- **Boundaries over shortcuts**: Authentication artifacts belong at boundaries, not in internal flows
