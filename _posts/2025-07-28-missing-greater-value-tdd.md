---

TDD's practical reality often contradicts its theoretical promise. Constant test rewrites during discovery, mocking unknown contracts, building for unclear domains—it feels wasteful. I've achieved similar results faster through focused discovery followed by disciplined testing.

Yet I think we're framing TDD wrong—in a way that creates division rather than value. Here's a reframe that might bridge the gap between advocates and skeptics.

## The Problem

We see TDD primarily as a code quality tool. Advocates measure test coverage while skeptics see rewritten tests as waste. Both may be missing the greater potential.

## The Reframe: Tests as Executable Hypotheses

TDD isn't just testing code—**it's testing assumptions**. Every test is an executable hypothesis about user needs and business logic.

When tests change or get discarded during discovery, they're delivering value: proving which assumptions were wrong **before** you built the wrong thing.

## From Code Quality to Business Intelligence

Think "executable business hypotheses," not "code quality practice." This reframes TDD as a business intelligence tool that prevents the costliest mistake: solving the wrong problem.

**Changed tests have ROI.** They're evidence of assumptions validated or disproven before expensive implementation. Instead of arguing about coverage percentages, focus on assumption coverage: How quickly can you validate risky beliefs about what users need?

## The Takeaway

The goal isn't perfect tests—it's perfect understanding.

TDD's real value: **Failing fast on assumptions, not code.** Whether you write tests first or after discovery, focus on testing the assumptions that matter most to your users and business.
