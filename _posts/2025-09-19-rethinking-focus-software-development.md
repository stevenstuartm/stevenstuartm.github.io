I thought focus meant exclusion—mastering one thing completely before moving to the next.

I was wrong. **Focus isn't about exclusion. It's about presence.**

## The Problem with Single-Minded Focus

Channeling all energy into one area atrophies everything else. Like exercising only one muscle group—you gain strength there while losing it everywhere else.

For developers: Becoming a React expert while losing touch with CS fundamentals, system design, or emerging technologies. **You master one thing but lose the ability to apply it in the real world.**

## Intervals of Development

Instead of deep-work obsession, practice **intervals of development**—visit important skill areas regularly with variable depth based on discovery.

**Benefits:**
- **Prevents skill decay** through regular activation
- **Accelerates learning** via cross-domain connections
- **Builds cognitive flexibility** through integration across domains
- **Reduces anxiety** by ensuring nothing critical gets neglected

## What True Focus Actually Means

True focus is **full commitment to whatever deserves attention in each moment**, guided by the work's natural rhythms—not arbitrary deadlines or obsessive completion.

This is challenging for those of us who treat every task as urgent and world-ending. Beyond daily practice, we must evolve our perspective on what ourselves, our teams, and stakeholders actually need.

**The shift:** From "I must finish this NOW" to "What deserves my full attention right now, and what can wait?"
