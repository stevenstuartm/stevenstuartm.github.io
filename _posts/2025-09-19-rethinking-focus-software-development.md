title: "Being Focused Is Not What I Thought It Was"

I used to implicitly think that focus meant doing one thing at the exclusion of all others. As if building expertise was a simple learning machine you could feed single inputs into until you mastered a subject and then move on to the next.

But I've learned focus isn't about exclusion. It's about presence. This might seem rather obvious to many (or most), but such a simple objective truth evaded me for many years.

## The Problem with Single-Minded Focus

When we channel all our energy into one area for too long, we lose our edge everywhere else. It's like only exercising one muscle group—you get strong there but lose strength and health elsewhere. For developers, this might mean becoming expert in React while losing touch with fundamental CS principles, system design thinking, or emerging technologies.

You can become a master at one thing but lose the ability to actually implement that mastery in the real world.

## Intervals of Development

Instead of deep work obsession, I now try to practice "intervals of development"—visiting each important skill area daily, but with variable depth based on what I discover.

Why this works:
- **Prevents skill decay** through regular activation
- **Accelerates learning** via cross-domain connections
- **Builds cognitive flexibility** as your brain integrates across domains
- **Reduces anxiety** by ensuring nothing important gets neglected

## True Focus

True focus is the ability to be fully committed to whatever deserves your attention in each moment, guided by the natural rhythms of the work itself.

But that is easy to say and not so easy to do for those of us who tend to become obsessed with one task—as if the whole world depends on us completing it... and now! Other than daily repetition, we need to always strive to gain and evolve our perspective of the needs of ourselves, our teams, and our stakeholders.
