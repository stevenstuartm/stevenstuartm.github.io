Organizations face genuine pain in candidate evaluation. With hundreds of applications for each role, hiring managers desperately need efficient filters to manage the overwhelming noise.

LeetCode interviews offer the appealing illusion of objectivity and scalability—a standardized way to quickly assess "technical ability." This desperation is understandable, but the solution is ultimately doomed to fail because it optimizes for the wrong signals.

## The Problem

Such a method measures one narrow skill while ignoring the multidisciplinary nature of modern software engineering. They systematically exclude capable engineers who excel at actual job requirements while potentially hiring those who optimize for interview performance over workplace effectiveness.

The issue isn't that algorithmic knowledge is worthless—it's foundational. The problem is that memorized pattern matching masquerading as algorithmic understanding creates a hiring process optimized against skills that actually matter.

The ability to regurgitate memorized patterns under time pressure doesn't correlate with architecting systems, debugging production issues, or collaborating effectively with product teams.

## The Irony

Ironically, when performance optimization is needed, it's usually at the system level (database queries, caching strategies, network calls).

LeetCode interviews don't just miss the mark—they're counterproductive. While organizations understandably seek efficient hiring filters, this approach creates more problems than it solves.

## The Reality

Build your algorithmic foundation and language expertise, but recognize that memorizing interview puzzles is both intellectually dishonest and professionally irrelevant to the complex, collaborative work of building software systems.
