The #1 measure of good code isn't cleverness, performance, or even correctness—**it's adaptability.**

Code that survives and thrives bends without breaking. Throughout my career, I've consistently prioritized building for change over premature optimization. (With occasional learning moments, I'll admit.)

## "Getting It Right First" Is The Wrong Goal

You will never get it right the first time. And that's not a failure—it's a feature of how innovation actually works. Instead of chasing perfection upfront, embrace the power of iterative excellence. Give yourself the opportunity to deliver, learn, and evolve.

## The "Easy to Implement" Principles That Pay Dividends

These aren't revolutionary—they're fundamental. The magic is in actually applying them:

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each piece does one thing well
- **Dependency Injection** - Don't hardcode what can change
- **Configuration Over Convention (Where It Matters)** - Make the changeable configurable
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud** - Know immediately when something breaks

## Principles in Action

- Implement clean interfaces and separation of concerns
- Write tests that give you confidence to make changes with impunity
- Use consistent naming and structure for optimal comprehension
- Deploy feature flags for controlled feature velocity
- Build monitoring and observability for fast and constant feedback

## The Bottom Line

In our industry, the survivors aren't the ones who write perfect code—they're the ones who evolve and write code that evolves with them.

As a tangent... this is partially why, for now, I would gamble on senior devs and architects outlasting the AI bubble.
