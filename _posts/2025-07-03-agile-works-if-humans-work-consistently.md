Agile methodologies can work consistently if we humans work and plan consistently by adhering to agreements and by maintaining a steadfast focus on needed deliverables.

- Align with the need (again and again and again)
- Agree to the plan (this is not just a waterfall thing)
- Apply the plan and deliver (be focused and deliberate)

The theory of Agile is not flawed at its root, but when it is sold as a product instead of leveraged in a prudent and contextual way it becomes self-serving and rotten. Here are some specific failure points that I have experienced that I think harm the effectiveness of agile methodologies:

## 1. Personnel Alignment

- Effective Agile implementation necessitates integrity over mere experience.
- Establish clarity and reasonable expectations within the organizational culture through training and decisive actions.

## 2. Flawed Responsibility Matrix

- Inadequate customer involvement, insufficient authority from the product owner, or a lack of empowerment within the development team can hinder progress.
- Understand the commitments made by leadership and ensure team training while continually asking the right questions.

## 3. Alignment Assumptions

- Misinterpretation of intervals of done by the customer or discrepancies in goal comprehension among stakeholders can lead to misalignment.
- Foster continuous alignment among stakeholders, encourage open communication, and be prepared for evolving requirements.

## 4. Sprints

- Sprints often devolve into task-driven activities rather than focusing on tangible and COMPLETED deliverables. This imaginary and needless line is not truly there to drive the deliverable; it is often more about appearances than reality.
- Prioritize meaningful discussions over unnecessary meetings, emphasizing quality and alignment over rigid patterns.
- Evaluate the metrics being used; prioritize quality and adherence to budget over speed and "velocity".
- Embrace the structured approach of Scrum alongside the sustained focus of Kanban.

## 5. Team Size and Focus

- Large, unfocused tech or "component" teams can hinder progress, emphasizing the need for cohesive, purpose-driven feature teams.
- Foster strong team cohesion with well-defined goals while minimizing bureaucratic hurdles.
- Implement a specialized hierarchy of architects and tech leads to support feature teams effectively (System, UI, Services, Data).
