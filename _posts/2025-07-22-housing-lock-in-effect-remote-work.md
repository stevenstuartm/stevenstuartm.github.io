Seeing the record number of homes for sale in my city, looking more and more like a severe traffic jam, I am wondering if the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates elevated could inadvertently create or is already creating a required increase in remote IT job opportunities.

As someone who's been watching the housing market due to trying to sell my own property, I have found myself unable to make any significant permanent geographic change. For many, moving means losing a massive chunk of money in current investments and future payments. Going from a lower rate to a high one loses you a lot of money. Selling your home far below market value in order to make the sale feasible for those who can't afford the current rate loses you even more money.

## The Numbers

- Mortgage rates hovering around 6.7%â€”nearly double what many homeowners locked in during 2020-2022
- Home sales at 75% of normal activity for three consecutive years
- 76% of mortgage holders have rates at 5% or lower, creating massive disincentive to move
- Median home prices at all-time highs ($435,300 nationally)

## The Question for Employers

When the market's talent can't afford to relocate to your headquarters, what do you do as an employer? You adapt. You could go remote.

## Are We Seeing This?

Are we seeing anything to confirm this? Have housing costs influenced your career decisions lately?
