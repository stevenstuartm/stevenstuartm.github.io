## NIST Incident Response Lifecycle

NIST released updated incident response guidance in April 2025, emphasizing six key principles aligned with CSF 2.0:

### Core Principles (CSF 2.0 Alignment)
1. **Govern**: Establish cybersecurity risk management strategy
2. **Identify**: Asset management and risk assessment
3. **Protect**: Implement appropriate safeguards
4. **Detect**: Develop and implement detection activities
5. **Respond**: Take action regarding detected incidents
6. **Recover**: Maintain resilience and restore capabilities

### Incident Response Team Structure
NIST recommends expanding beyond traditional "incident handler" teams to include company leadership, legal teams, technology professionals, public relations teams, and human resources.

**Core Team Roles**:
- **Incident Commander**: Overall response coordination
- **Security Analyst**: Technical investigation and analysis
- **Legal Counsel**: Regulatory and liability guidance
- **Communications**: Internal and external messaging
- **Management**: Business decision making
- **IT Operations**: System restoration and hardening

### Response Phases

#### Preparation
- **Policies and Procedures**: Documented response plans
- **Team Training**: Regular drills and exercises
- **Tools and Resources**: Incident response toolkit
- **Communication Plans**: Internal and external contacts
- **Legal Preparations**: Regulatory notification procedures

#### Detection and Analysis
- **Event Detection**: Monitoring and alerting systems
- **Initial Assessment**: Incident classification and scoping
- **Evidence Collection**: Forensic data preservation
- **Impact Analysis**: Business and technical impact assessment
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Management and team alerts

#### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- **Short-term Containment**: Immediate threat isolation
- **Long-term Containment**: Sustained threat mitigation
- **Eradication**: Root cause removal
- **Recovery**: System restoration and monitoring
- **Validation**: Verification of successful recovery

#### Post-Incident Activity
- **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement identification
- **Documentation**: Complete incident record
- **Evidence Retention**: Legal and compliance requirements
- **Process Updates**: Policy and procedure refinements

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- **Critical Process Identification**: Essential business functions
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss
- **Dependency Mapping**: Internal and external dependencies

### Recovery Strategies

#### Site Recovery Options
- **Hot Site**: Fully operational backup facility
- **Warm Site**: Partially equipped facility (hours to days)
- **Cold Site**: Basic facility with infrastructure only
- **Cloud Recovery**: Virtual recovery environments
- **Mobile Sites**: Portable recovery facilities

#### Data Backup Strategies
- **Full Backup**: Complete data copy
- **Incremental Backup**: Changes since last backup
- **Differential Backup**: Changes since last full backup
- **Continuous Data Protection**: Real-time data replication
- **3-2-1 Rule**: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite

### Recovery Testing
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Discussion-based scenarios
- **Functional Tests**: Specific system component testing
- **Full-Scale Tests**: Complete environment simulation
- **Regular Schedule**: Annual or bi-annual testing
- **Documentation**: Test results and improvement plans
