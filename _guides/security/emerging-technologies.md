## Artificial Intelligence Security

### AI/ML Security Challenges
CISA and international partners released joint guidance on AI Data Security best practices in May 2025, highlighting critical risks across the AI lifecycle.

**Key Security Concerns**:
- **Data Poisoning**: Malicious training data injection
- **Model Inversion**: Extracting training data from models
- **Adversarial Examples**: Inputs designed to fool AI systems
- **Prompt Injection**: Manipulating AI system inputs
- **Model Theft**: Unauthorized model replication

### AI Security Best Practices
- **Secure AI Development**: Security-by-design principles
- **Data Protection**: Training data classification and access controls
- **Model Validation**: Adversarial testing and validation
- **Runtime Protection**: Input validation and output filtering
- **Monitoring**: AI system behavior analysis

## Cloud Security

### Shared Responsibility Model
- **Cloud Provider**: Physical security, infrastructure, platform services
- **Customer**: Data, identity, applications, network controls, operating system

### Cloud Security Challenges
- **Visibility**: Limited insight into cloud infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements in cloud
- **Data Location**: Geographic and jurisdictional considerations
- **Identity Management**: Federated identity and access management
- **Configuration**: Secure cloud service configuration

### Cloud Security Tools
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Configuration assessment
- **Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)**: Runtime workload security
- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**: Data protection and compliance
- **Container Security**: Image scanning, runtime protection
- **Serverless Security**: Function-level security controls

## Internet of Things (IoT) Security

### IoT Security Challenges
- **Device Constraints**: Limited processing power and memory
- **Update Management**: Difficult firmware patching
- **Default Credentials**: Weak or unchanged default passwords
- **Network Exposure**: Direct internet connectivity
- **Device Lifecycle**: Long deployment periods with minimal maintenance

### NIST IoT Security Framework
NIST continues to develop IoT cybersecurity guidance, with foundational activities including:
- **Device Identification**: Asset inventory and management
- **Device Configuration**: Secure initial setup
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and access controls
- **Interface Security**: Secure communications
- **Software Updates**: Secure update mechanisms
- **Cybersecurity State Awareness**: Monitoring and logging

## Blockchain and Distributed Systems

### Smart Contract Security (OWASP Smart Contract Top 10 2025)
1. **Access Control Vulnerabilities**: Poorly implemented permissions
2. **Arithmetic Issues**: Integer overflow/underflow
3. **Unchecked External Calls**: Reentrancy attacks
4. **Lack of Input Validation**: Unvalidated user inputs
5. **Reentrancy Attacks**: Callback exploitation
6. **Gas Limit Vulnerabilities**: Resource exhaustion
7. **Weak Randomness**: Predictable random number generation
8. **Privacy Issues**: On-chain data exposure
9. **Logic Issues**: Smart contract business logic flaws
10. **Denial of Service**: Contract unavailability attacks

### Blockchain Security Considerations
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake security
- **Key Management**: Private key security and recovery
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Code review and formal verification
- **Network Security**: Node protection and communication security

## Quantum Computing Implications

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **Timeline**: NIST standardization in progress
- **Impact**: Current encryption algorithms vulnerable
- **Migration Strategy**: Hybrid classical-quantum resistant systems
- **Standards**:
  - **NIST SP 800-208**: Recommendation for Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes
  - **NIST SP 800-232**: Ascon-Based Lightweight Cryptography (released 2025)

### Quantum-Safe Algorithms
- **Key Exchange**: CRYSTALS-Kyber
- **Digital Signatures**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+
- **Hash-Based Signatures**: XMSS, LMS
- **Implementation**: Gradual transition and testing
