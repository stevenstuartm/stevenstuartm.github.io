## Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

### Security-Integrated Development Process
1. **Planning**: Security requirements, threat modeling
2. **Design**: Secure architecture, security controls
3. **Implementation**: Secure coding, code reviews
4. **Testing**: Security testing, vulnerability assessment
5. **Deployment**: Secure configuration, monitoring
6. **Maintenance**: Patch management, security updates

### DevSecOps Integration
- **Shift Left**: Early security integration
- **Automation**: Automated security testing in CI/CD
- **Collaboration**: Development, security, and operations teams
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runtime security analysis

## Threat Modeling

### Methodologies

#### STRIDE (Microsoft)
- **Spoofing**: Identity falsification
- **Tampering**: Data modification
- **Repudiation**: Denying actions
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized data access
- **Denial of Service**: System availability attacks
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Unauthorized access level increase

#### PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
- **Risk-Centric**: Focus on business risk
- **Seven-Stage Process**: From strategy to vulnerability analysis
- **Scalable**: Adaptable to different organization sizes

#### OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation)
- **Organizational Focus**: Business impact assessment
- **Asset-Centric**: Identify and protect critical assets
- **Self-Directed**: Organization-led assessment

## Secure Coding Practices

### Input Validation
- **Whitelist Approach**: Accept only known good input
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensure proper format and range
- **Encoding**: Prevent injection attacks
- **Sanitization**: Remove or escape dangerous characters

### Authentication and Session Management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Something you know, have, are
- **Strong Session Management**: Secure tokens, proper timeouts
- **Password Security**: Hashing, salting, complexity requirements
- **Account Lockout**: Prevent brute force attacks

### Error Handling
- **Information Disclosure**: Avoid revealing system details
- **Logging**: Record security events without sensitive data
- **User Experience**: Helpful messages without security risks
