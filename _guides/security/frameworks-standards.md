## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

NIST released CSF 2.0 in February 2024, expanding beyond critical infrastructure to serve all organization types and sizes. The framework now includes six core functions:

### Core Functions
1. **Govern (NEW)**: Cybersecurity risk management strategy and oversight
2. **Identify**: Asset management, risk assessment, governance
3. **Protect**: Access control, awareness training, data security
4. **Detect**: Anomaly detection, continuous monitoring
5. **Respond**: Response planning, communications, analysis
6. **Recover**: Recovery planning, improvements, communications

### Key Improvements in CSF 2.0
- Expanded scope for all organizations, not just critical infrastructure
- New governance component emphasizing cybersecurity as enterprise risk
- Enhanced supply chain risk management guidance
- Improved integration with other frameworks
- Quick-start guides for different audiences

## OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

### OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021)
OWASP is currently collecting data for the Top 10:2025, with contributions accepted until July 31, 2025.

Current Top 10 (2021):
1. **A01: Broken Access Control** - Access restriction failures
2. **A02: Cryptographic Failures** - Poor encryption implementation
3. **A03: Injection** - Code injection attacks (includes XSS)
4. **A04: Insecure Design** - Design and architecture flaws
5. **A05: Security Misconfiguration** - Improper system configuration
6. **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Insecure dependencies
7. **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures** - Session management flaws
8. **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Insecure CI/CD pipelines
9. **A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** - Insufficient detection
10. **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** - Server manipulation attacks

### OWASP Top 10 for AI/LLM Applications (2025)
OWASP has released a specialized Top 10 for Large Language Model applications in 2025:

1. **LLM01: Prompt Injection** - Manipulating AI model inputs
2. **LLM02: Sensitive Information Disclosure** - Unintended data exposure
3. **LLM03: Supply Chain** - Compromised training data or models
4. **LLM04: Data and Model Poisoning** - Malicious training data
5. **LLM05: Improper Output Handling** - Unsafe output processing
6. **LLM06: Excessive Agency** - Over-privileged AI systems
7. **LLM07: System Prompt Leakage** - Exposing system instructions
8. **LLM08: Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** - ML model vulnerabilities
9. **LLM09: Misinformation** - AI-generated false information
10. **LLM10: Unbounded Consumption** - Resource exhaustion attacks
