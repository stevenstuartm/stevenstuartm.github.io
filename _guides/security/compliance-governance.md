## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Process
1. **Asset Identification**: Catalog valuable resources
2. **Threat Identification**: Potential attack vectors
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: System weaknesses
4. **Risk Analysis**: Impact and likelihood evaluation
5. **Risk Treatment**: Accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid

### Risk Rating (OWASP Methodology)
- **Likelihood Factors**:
  - Threat agent factors (skill, motive, opportunity, size)
  - Vulnerability factors (ease of discovery, exploit, awareness)
- **Impact Factors**:
  - Technical impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
  - Business impact (financial, reputation, non-compliance)

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)
- **Scope**: US publicly traded companies
- **Requirements**: Financial reporting controls and certification
- **IT Impact**: Financial system security and access controls

### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- **Scope**: Organizations handling credit card data
- **Requirements**:
  - Secure network and systems
  - Protect cardholder data
  - Maintain vulnerability management program
  - Strong access control measures
  - Regular monitoring and testing
  - Information security policy

### SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- **Trust Criteria**: Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy
- **Report Types**: Type I (point in time), Type II (period of time)
- **Audience**: Service providers and their customers

## Audit and Assessment

### Security Audit Process
1. **Planning**: Scope definition and resource allocation
2. **Fieldwork**: Evidence collection and testing
3. **Reporting**: Findings documentation and recommendations
4. **Follow-up**: Remediation tracking and verification

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Automated Compliance Checking**: Policy violation detection
- **Security Metrics**: Key performance indicators
- **Dashboard Reporting**: Executive visibility
- **Trend Analysis**: Security posture evolution
