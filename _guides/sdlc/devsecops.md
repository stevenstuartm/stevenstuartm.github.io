## What is DevSecOps

**DevSecOps** is the practice of integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), rather than treating it as a separate phase at the end. It extends the DevOps philosophy of collaboration and automation to include security as a shared responsibility across development, operations, and security teams.

### Core Principles

1. **Security as Code**: Treat security policies, configurations, and infrastructure as code that can be versioned, tested, and automated
2. **Shift-Left Security**: Move security considerations earlier in the development process to catch issues when they're cheaper to fix
3. **Continuous Security**: Integrate security checks into automated pipelines for ongoing validation
4. **Shared Responsibility**: Security is everyone's job, not just the security team's
5. **Automation First**: Automate security testing, scanning, and compliance checks wherever possible

### Why DevSecOps Matters

- **Early Detection**: Finding vulnerabilities during development is 10-100x cheaper than finding them in production
- **Faster Delivery**: Automated security checks don't slow down deployment pipelines
- **Reduced Risk**: Continuous security validation reduces the attack surface
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance checking makes audits easier
- **Security Culture**: Embedding security in workflows builds security awareness across teams

## Shift-Left Security

**Shift-left security** means moving security practices earlier (to the "left") in the development timeline, rather than treating security as a gate at the end.

### What Shift-Left Means in Practice

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Plan → Design → Develop → Test → Security Review → Deploy
                                      ↑
                              Security happens here
```

**Shift-Left Approach:**
```
Plan → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy
  ↓      ↓        ↓        ↓       ↓
Security integrated at every phase
```

### Early Security Integration

**During Planning & Requirements:**
- Threat modeling to identify potential attack vectors
- Security requirements defined alongside functional requirements
- Privacy impact assessments
- Compliance requirements identified early

**During Design:**
- Security architecture review
- Authentication and authorization design
- Data flow and trust boundary analysis
- Security controls selection

**During Development:**
- Secure coding standards and training
- IDE security plugins for real-time feedback
- Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- Code review with security focus

**During Testing:**
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Unit tests for security controls
- Security regression testing
- Penetration testing early and often

### Benefits of Shift-Left Security

- **Lower Cost**: Fixing vulnerabilities during development costs far less than fixing them in production
- **Faster Remediation**: Developers fix issues while context is fresh
- **Better Design**: Security considerations influence architecture from the start
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer vulnerabilities make it to production
- **Developer Empowerment**: Developers gain security skills and ownership

## Secrets Management

### What Are Secrets?

Secrets are sensitive pieces of information that grant access to systems, services, or data:
- API keys and tokens
- Database passwords
- Private keys and certificates
- OAuth client secrets
- Encryption keys
- Service account credentials

### Secrets Management Best Practices

**1. Never Commit Secrets to Version Control**

- Use environment variables instead
- Run secret detection tools to catch accidents

**2. Use Dedicated Secrets Management Tools**
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- Google Cloud Secret Manager
- 1Password / LastPass (for team secrets)

**3. Rotate Secrets Regularly**
- Automate rotation where possible
- Have a rotation schedule for all secrets
- Rotate immediately if exposure is suspected

**4. Use Short-Lived Credentials**
- Prefer temporary tokens over long-lived credentials
- Use IAM roles and service accounts where possible
- Implement just-in-time access

**5. Apply Least Privilege**
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Use separate credentials for different environments
- Regularly audit and revoke unused credentials

**6. Encrypt Secrets at Rest and in Transit**
- Use TLS for all network communication
- Encrypt secrets in configuration files
- Use encrypted storage for secrets

### Secrets in Different Environments

**Development:**
- Use local environment variables or `.env` files (not committed)
- Use mock credentials where possible
- Limit access to production secrets

**CI/CD:**
- Use CI/CD platform secret management
- Inject secrets as environment variables at runtime
- Never log secrets in build output

**Staging/Production:**
- Use cloud provider secret management services
- Inject secrets at runtime, not build time
- Implement strict access controls
- Monitor and audit secret access
