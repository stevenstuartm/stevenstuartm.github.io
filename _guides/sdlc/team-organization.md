## Overview

**Team architecture** refers to how development teams are structured, how they interact, and how architectural decisions are made and governed across the organization. Effective team architecture aligns team boundaries with system boundaries, promotes autonomy while maintaining consistency, and enables teams to deliver value independently.

### Why Team Architecture Matters

- **Conway's Law**: Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure
- **Autonomy**: Well-structured teams can make decisions and deliver without excessive coordination
- **Consistency**: Clear architectural roles ensure consistency across teams
- **Scalability**: Good team architecture enables organizations to scale development efforts
- **Quality**: Clear ownership leads to better system design and code quality

## Team Structure Patterns

### Feature Teams vs. Component Teams

#### Feature Teams

**What they are:** Cross-functional teams organized around business features or customer-facing capabilities.

**Structure:**
- Include all skills needed to deliver end-to-end features (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
- Own complete vertical slices of functionality
- Responsible for full lifecycle (development, testing, deployment, maintenance)

**When to use:**
- Product-focused organizations
- When delivering customer value quickly is priority
- Teams working on distinct product areas
- Organizations embracing microservices

**Benefits:**
- Faster delivery of customer value
- Reduced handoffs and dependencies
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Better understanding of business domain

**Challenges:**
- Potential code duplication across teams
- Maintaining technical consistency
- Shared component ownership can be unclear

#### Component Teams

**What they are:** Teams organized around technical components or layers (UI team, API team, database team).

**Structure:**
- Specialized by technical layer or component
- Deep expertise in specific technologies
- Work on requests from multiple feature teams

**When to use:**
- Legacy systems with strong layer coupling
- Highly specialized technical domains
- Platform or infrastructure teams
- Organizations with strong architectural governance

**Benefits:**
- Deep technical expertise
- Consistency within technical domains
- Efficient use of specialized skills
- Easier to maintain technical standards

**Challenges:**
- Handoffs between teams slow delivery
- Lack of end-to-end ownership
- Harder to prioritize work
- Risk of becoming bottlenecks

### Hybrid Models

**Practical Reality:**
Most organizations use a hybrid approach:
- Feature teams for product development
- Platform/component teams for shared infrastructure (authentication, data platform, CI/CD)
- Architecture team for governance and standards

## Domain-Driven Team Organization

### Bounded Contexts and Team Boundaries

**Bounded Context:** A logical boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable.

**Aligning teams with bounded contexts:**
- Each team owns one or more bounded contexts
- Context boundaries define team boundaries
- Clear interfaces between contexts minimize coordination
- Teams can evolve their context independently

### Domain APIs Within Monoliths

Even in monolithic applications, domain-driven organization provides benefits:

**Internal Domain APIs:**
- Each domain exposes clear API boundaries
- Other domains interact through these APIs, not direct database access
- Enables future extraction to microservices
- Maintains encapsulation and reduces coupling

**Example in a Monolithic E-Commerce System:**
- **Catalog Domain**: Product information, categories, search
- **Order Domain**: Order management, order history
- **Payment Domain**: Payment processing, billing
- **Shipping Domain**: Shipping calculation, fulfillment tracking

Each domain has clear APIs, even though all code is in one codebase.

### Team Ownership

**Clear Responsibility:**
- Each team owns their domain's code, data, and services
- Teams responsible for quality, performance, and reliability of their domain
- Teams handle operational support for their domain

**Benefits:**
- Reduced cognitive load (teams focus on their domain)
- Faster decision-making within domain boundaries
- Clear accountability
- Domain expertise develops naturally

- Delegate decision-making authority
- Increase team capacity
- Reduce dependencies through better boundaries

### The Ivory Tower Architects

**Problem:** Architects disconnected from implementation, making impractical decisions.

**Solution:**
- Architects stay close to code
- Regular involvement in code reviews
- Time spent on hands-on technical work
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Close collaboration with development teams

### The Competitive Teams

**Problem:** Teams competing rather than collaborating, duplicating work or working at cross purposes.

**Solution:**
- Align incentives around shared goals
- Encourage cross-team collaboration
- Celebrate collective wins
- Clear domain boundaries
- Regular cross-team communication

## Keys to Successful Team Architecture

1. **Align Team Structure with System Architecture**: Use Conway's Law to your advantage
2. **Balance Autonomy and Alignment**: Teams need freedom to move fast, but consistency is important
3. **Clear Ownership**: Every piece of code, service, and domain should have a clear owner
4. **Invest in Platforms**: Platform teams enable feature team autonomy
5. **Communication Over Process**: Good communication reduces the need for heavy coordination processes
6. **Evolve Continuously**: Team structure should adapt as the organization and system evolve
