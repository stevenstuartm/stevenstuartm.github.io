## SMART Goals Framework

**SMART** goals provide a framework for setting clear, attainable, and measurable objectives throughout the SDLC.

- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous goals (e.g., "increase API response time by 200ms" vs. "improve performance")
- **Measurable**: Use quantifiable metrics (numbers, percentages, specific criteria)
- **Achievable**: Realistic given available resources and constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with overall project/business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Include specific deadlines to create urgency and accountability

---

## AAA Cycle (Align-Agree-Apply)

A personal framework for consistent agile execution that maintains focus on deliverables through three key phases:

### 1. Align with the Need

**Stakeholder & Requirements Analysis**
- Identify and analyze all stakeholders
- Define clear project goals and objectives
- Gather significant use cases and requirements
- Identify deliverables using SMART criteria

**Project Scope & Planning**
- Document timing, sequence, dependencies, and integration points
- Identify assumptions and pull them from people's heads
- Assess constraints (system quality attributes, compliance regulations)
- Evaluate risks (unknowns, quality/functionality intersections, organizational appetite)
- Create development and infrastructure estimates

**Project Charter Essentials**
- Executive summary with goals, approach, and key personnel
- Clear scope definition (in-scope and out-of-scope items)
- Authority levels and delegation for project manager
- Communication plan and data storage strategy
- High-level risks and success criteria

### 2. Agree to the Plan

**Design & Architecture Agreement**
- High-level design with layers, components, and workflows
- Service level agreements and objectives
- Quality assurance plan with clear testing strategy
- Budget allocations and realistic estimations
- Working proof of concept demonstration

### 3. Apply the Plan and Deliver

**Implementation & Delivery**
- Detailed component design with clear roles
- Architecture reviews and design sessions
- Tech stack selection considering:
  - Requirements support and popularity
  - Cost and longevity factors
  - Security (CVEs, supply chain considerations)
  - In-house expertise vs. open contribution

## Shape Up Development Methodology

*Developed by Basecamp (Ryan Singer, 2019) as an alternative to Scrum. Documented in "Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters"*

### Shaping Process
1. **Set Boundaries**: Define time appetite and problem scope
2. **Rough Out Elements**: High-level solution sketching without detailed wireframes
3. **Address Risks**: Identify and mitigate rabbit holes before development
4. **Write the Pitch**: Formal write-up summarizing problem, solution, and constraints

### Betting Approach
- **No Backlogs**: Avoid accumulating outdated ideas that create false urgency
- **Six-Week Cycles**: Regular betting meetings with focused, shaped options
- **Decentralized Tracking**: Teams maintain their own relevant lists
- **Important Ideas Return**: Truly valuable concepts will resurface naturally

### Building Principles
- **Assign Projects, Not Tasks**: Teams own entire projects and define their approach
- **Done Means Deployed**: Complete cycles end with production deployment
- **Start in the Middle**: Begin with core, novel problems rather than peripheral features
- **Integrate by Slice**: Develop complete vertical features, not isolated components

## SDLC Methodologies Comparison

### Overview
Most legacy SDLC methodologies aren't even taught in University or bootcamp classrooms. Instead, today's classes teach Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. However, understanding different methodologies helps choose the right approach for specific project needs and constraints.

### Traditional Methodologies

#### Waterfall Model

*Formalized by Winston W. Royce in 1970 paper "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems." Ironically, Royce actually argued against the pure waterfall approach, but it became the dominant methodology anyway.*

**What it is:** A stricter, more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages in the SDLC. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Sequential, linear progression through phases
- Extensive upfront planning and documentation
- Fixed requirements defined at the beginning
- Limited flexibility for changes once started

**When to Use:**
- Projects with well-defined, stable requirements
- Regulatory or compliance-heavy environments
- Projects requiring extensive documentation
- Teams comfortable with structured, predictable processes
- Fixed-bid contracts with clear deliverables

**Why Choose Waterfall:**
- **Predictability**: Clear timelines and deliverables
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive specifications and records
- **Control**: Strong project governance and oversight
- **Risk Management**: Thorough planning reduces surprises

**Limitations:**
- Inflexible to changing requirements
- Late discovery of issues
- Extended time to market
- Limited customer feedback during development

---

### Agile Family of Methodologies

*Agile Manifesto created by 17 software developers in 2001 (Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin, and others) emphasizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.*

**Core Agile Principles:**
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

#### Scrum Framework

*Developed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber in early 1990s, formalized in 1995. Based on empirical process control theory and influenced by Takeuchi & Nonaka's "The New New Product Development Game" (1986).*

**What it is:** An Agile methodology that uses an incremental approach to work in order to complete projects more quickly. Scrum uses two-week sprints to get work done.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fixed-length sprints (typically 1-4 weeks)
