## What is the SDLC

The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a structured process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software systems. It provides a systematic approach to software development that helps teams deliver high-quality software efficiently, predictably, and within budget.

### Why SDLC Matters

- **Reduces Risk**: Structured processes identify and mitigate risks early
- **Improves Quality**: Built-in quality checkpoints throughout development
- **Enables Planning**: Predictable phases help with resource allocation and scheduling
- **Facilitates Communication**: Common framework for stakeholders to discuss progress
- **Supports Maintenance**: Well-documented lifecycle makes systems easier to maintain and evolve

### SDLC vs. Development Methodologies

**SDLC** is the overarching process framework, while **methodologies** (like Agile, Waterfall, Scrum) define how you move through the SDLC phases:

- The SDLC phases remain consistent: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance
- Methodologies determine the approach: sequential (Waterfall), iterative (Agile), timeboxed (Scrum), continuous flow (Kanban)

For detailed comparison of methodologies, see the [SDLC Methodologies Comparison](sdlc-methodologies.md) guide.

### Core SDLC Principles

Regardless of methodology, effective SDLCs share common principles:

1. **Understand Before Building**: Invest time in requirements and design before coding
2. **Build Quality In**: Don't treat quality as a separate phase
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Learn from each cycle and refine processes
4. **Collaborate Across Disciplines**: Developers, designers, ops, security, and business work together
5. **Automate What You Can**: Reduce manual work through automation (testing, deployment, scanning)
6. **Measure and Adapt**: Use metrics to understand performance and guide improvements

## SMART Goals Framework

**SMART** goals provide a framework for setting clear, attainable, and measurable objectives throughout the SDLC.

- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous goals (e.g., "increase API response time by 200ms" vs. "improve performance")
- **Measurable**: Use quantifiable metrics (numbers, percentages, specific criteria)
- **Achievable**: Realistic given available resources and constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with overall project/business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Include specific deadlines to create urgency and accountability

## Core SDLC Phases

The SDLC consists of six core phases that software moves through from conception to retirement. While different methodologies approach these phases differently (sequential vs. iterative), the fundamental activities remain consistent.

### 1. Planning & Requirements

**What happens in this phase:**
The planning phase establishes the foundation for the entire project by defining what needs to be built and why.

**Key Activities:**

**Ideation & Problem Definition:**
- Identify business problems or opportunities
- Conduct market research and competitive analysis
- Validate problem-solution fit
- Define project vision and goals

**Requirements Gathering:**
- Engage stakeholders to understand needs
- Document functional requirements (what the system should do)
- Define non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, usability)
- Prioritize requirements based on business value
- Create user stories, use cases, or requirement specifications

**Feasibility Study:**
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build this with available technology?
- **Financial Feasibility**: Do we have budget? What's the ROI?
- **Resource Feasibility**: Do we have the right team and skills?
- **Operational Feasibility**: Can we support and maintain this?
- **Schedule Feasibility**: Can we deliver in the required timeframe?

**Project Charter & Approval:**
- Formal document authorizing the project
- Define scope, objectives, and success criteria
- Assign project manager and key roles
- Allocate initial budget and resources
