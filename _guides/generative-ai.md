### Key Characteristics:
- **Creative**: Produces original content across multiple modalities
- **Adaptive**: Learns from examples and adjusts to specific requirements
- **Scalable**: Can generate large volumes of content efficiently
- **Interactive**: Responds to user inputs and iterates based on feedback

## Essential Concepts and Definitions

### **Agentic AI**
AI systems that can accomplish specific goals with limited supervision, consisting of AI agents that mimic human decision-making to solve problems in real time. In 2025, 88% of executives plan to increase AI-related budgets specifically because of agentic AI's potential.

**Examples**: Smart personal assistants, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity systems, healthcare management tools

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
Machine learning technology that enables computers to interpret, manipulate, and comprehend human language, forming the foundation for most generative AI text applications.

### **Tokens**
The fundamental units of text that AI models use to process and understand language. These can be words, subwords, or individual characters, depending on the tokenization method. Understanding tokens is crucial for managing costs and context limits.

### **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.

### **Transformers**
The underlying neural network architecture that enables modern generative AI models to handle large amounts of data efficiently and generate complex outputs. The "T" in GPT stands for Transformer.

### **Hallucination**
When AI models generate information that appears plausible but is actually false or fabricated. This is a key limitation to understand when working with generative AI.

### **Fine-tuning**
The process of adapting a pre-trained AI model for specific tasks or domains by training it on specialized datasets.

### **Context Window**
The amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI model can consider at once when generating responses. Larger context windows allow for more complex conversations and document analysis.

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs that guide AI models to generate desired outputs. In 2025, prompt engineering has evolved beyond simple tricks to encompass formatting techniques, reasoning scaffolds, role assignments, and security considerations.

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Give Direction**
Describe the desired style in detail or reference a relevant persona.

**Examples**:
- "As a professional financial analyst who must follow regulatory compliance..."
- "In the style of a technical documentation writer, explain..."
- "Acting as an experienced marketing strategist..."

#### 2. **Specify Format**
Define rules to follow and the required structure of the response.

**Examples**:
- "Respond as a JSON object with the following fields..."
- "Format as a bullet-point list with exactly 5 items"
- "Structure as: Problem → Analysis → Recommendation"

#### 3. **Provide Examples**
Insert diverse test cases showing the task done correctly (few-shot prompting).

#### 4. **Evaluate Quality**
Test prompts multiple times to ensure consistent, high-quality results.

#### 5. **Divide Labor**
Split complex tasks into multiple steps or use chained prompts.

### Essential Techniques

#### **Zero-shot Prompting**
Technique where a language model performs a task without any examples, using clear, concise instructions.

**Example**:
```
"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points focusing on the main findings."
```

#### **Few-shot Prompting**
Technique where examples are included in the prompt to facilitate learning, particularly useful for complex tasks.

**Example**:
```
Grade these student responses following my style:

Homework: "The old clock tower chimed loudly, echoing through the deserted village square."
Grade: A
Reason: Well-written sentence with good imagery.

Homework: "She found a hidden note iside the ancient book."
Grade: B
Reason: Good concept, minor spelling error.

Now grade: "The garden was filled with beautiful flowers and trees."
```

#### **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)**
Technique that encourages AI to articulate its thought process step-by-step, particularly effective for complex problem-solving tasks.

**Example**:
```
"Solve this step by step, showing your reasoning:
If a store offers 25% off and an additional 10% off the discounted price, what's the final discount on a $100 item?"
```

### Advanced Strategies

#### **Persona-Based Prompting**
Assigning roles or personas to AI leads to more tailored, context-specific responses by providing a frame of reference for the model.

**Example**:
```
"You are a senior data scientist with 10 years of experience in healthcare analytics. 
Explain the concept of statistical significance to a hospital administrator 
who needs to understand clinical trial results."
```

#### **Task Decomposition**
Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

**Example**:
```
"I need help preparing a business presentation. Let's work through this step by step:
1. First, help me outline the key sections
2. Then we'll develop content for each section
3. Finally, we'll refine the messaging for the audience"
```

#### **Self-Consistency Prompting**
Technique involving sampling multiple outputs and comparing reasoning paths to identify common patterns, useful for complex reasoning tasks.

#### **Prompt Scaffolding**
Defensive prompting technique that wraps user inputs in structured templates to limit the model's ability to misbehave, even with adversarial input.

### Best Practices for 2025

Based on current research, here are key insights for effective prompt engineering:

1. **Structure Over Cleverness**: Clear structure and context matter more than clever wording
2. **Model-Specific Optimization**: Different models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) respond better to different formatting patterns
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Adopt an experimental approach to test various phrasing, layouts, and contextual cues
4. **Security Awareness**: Prompt engineering can be a security risk when exploited through adversarial techniques

#### **Key Parameters to Understand**

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in output. Higher temperature = more creative but less consistent. Use temperature 0 for factual tasks
- **Context Window**: Amount of text the model can process at once
- **System Prompts**: Background instructions that shape the AI's behavior throughout the conversation
