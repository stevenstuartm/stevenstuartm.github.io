# Architecture Decisions & Leadership

## Architect Responsibilities

1. **Make Architecture Decisions** - Define decisions and principles guiding technology choices
2. **Continually Analyze** - Assess architecture vitality as business and technology change
3. **Keep Current** - Stay updated on technical and industry trends
4. **Ensure Compliance** - Verify teams follow defined decisions and principles
5. **Understand Technologies** - Technical breadth over depth
6. **Know the Business** - Understand domain, problems, goals, requirements
7. **Lead Teams** - Exceptional interpersonal skills: teamwork, facilitation, leadership
8. **Navigate Politics** - Negotiation skills to get decisions approved

## Decision-Making

### Architectural Decision Antipatterns

**1. Covering Your Assets**

Fear of being wrong prevents making decisions.

**Solutions**: Last Responsible Moment (decide when cost of deferring > risk of deciding) | Collaborate to validate feasibility

**2. Groundhog Day**

Decisions get revisited repeatedly because people don't know why they were made.

**Solution**: Provide technical AND business justifications: Cost | Time to market | User satisfaction | Strategic positioning

**3. Email-Driven Architecture**

Decisions lost, forgotten, or unknown.

**Solution**: Store in single system of record | Email only links, not decision bodies

### Architectural Significance

A decision is architecturally significant if it affects:

- Structure (patterns/styles)
- Characteristics (performance, scalability)
- Dependencies (coupling)
- Interfaces (access/orchestration)
- Construction techniques (platforms, frameworks, tools)

---

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### Structure

**Title**: Numbered sequentially with short phrase
- Example: "42. Use Asynchronous Messaging Between Order and Payment Services"

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | RFC (with deadline)

**Approval Criteria**:
- Cost thresholds (e.g., >$5K requires review)
- Cross-team impact
- Security implications

**Context**: Forces at play
- Specific circumstances
- Possible alternatives
- Area affected

**Decision**: Affirmative, commanding voice
- Example: "We will use asynchronous messaging between services."
- Include full justification. **Why > How**

**Consequences**: Overall impact (pros and cons)
- Example: Better responsiveness (25ms vs 3,100ms) but complex error handling

**Compliance**: How will it be measured and governed?
- Manual checks | Automated fitness functions | Tools (ArchUnit, NetArchTest)

**Notes**: Metadata
- Author | Approval date | Approved by | Last modified | Superseded date

### Storage

Store in dedicated repository or wiki accessible to all stakeholders.

## Team Leadership

### Making Teams Effective

**Collaboration**: Break down architect/developer barriers. Form strong bidirectional relationships. Architecture changes every iteration—tight collaboration essential.

**Constraints & Boundaries**: Create appropriate constraints forming a "room" for teams. Provide right level of guidance—not too much, not too little.

### Architect Personalities

**Control-Freak Architect**: Too fine-grained decisions, tight boundaries, too many constraints → teams lose autonomy

**Armchair Architect**: Disconnected, no implementation details, loose boundaries → teams do architect's work

**Effective Architect**: Appropriate constraints, ensures collaboration, right guidance level, removes roadblocks

### Elastic Leadership

How involved should you be? Consider:

**Team Familiarity**: Better they know each other → less involvement

**Team Size**: Small (≤5) less | Large (>12) more

**Experience**: More juniors → more mentoring | More seniors → facilitator role

**Project Complexity**: High → more availability | Low → less involvement

**Project Duration**: Longer → more involvement over time

### Team Warning Signs

**Process Loss (Brooks's Law)**:

> "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."
>
> -- Fred Brooks, *The Mythical Man-Month* (1975)

When communication overhead exceeds productivity gains from additional people.

- **Indicators**: Frequent merge conflicts, working on same code, getting in each other's way
- **Solution**: Find parallelism; avoid adding people without parallel work available

**Pluralistic Ignorance** (*social psychology concept*):

Everyone privately rejects a norm but assumes others accept it, so publicly goes along.

- **Example**: Team thinks daily standups are waste of time but nobody speaks up, assuming others find them valuable
- **Solution**: Smaller teams where people feel psychologically safe to speak up

**Diffusion of Responsibility** (*social psychology concept*):

Large teams → unclear ownership → everyone assumes someone else will handle it → work gets dropped

- **Example**: Bug report in shared channel with 20 people; nobody picks it up
- **Solution**: Clear roles, explicit ownership, right-sized teams

---

## Providing Guidance

### Design Principles

Use principles to form constraint boundaries.

**Example: Third-Party Library Decision Framework**

**Special Purpose (Developer Decision)**:
- Specific functionality (PDFs, barcodes)
- Developer decides independently

**General Purpose (Architect Approval)**:
- Wrappers on language APIs
- Developer analysis + architect approval

**Framework (Architect Decision)**:
- Entire layers (persistence, IoC)
- Highly invasive
- Architect decides entirely

### Business Justifications

Ask for business value to increase awareness and enable better decisions.

## Leveraging Checklists

*Inspired by Atul Gawande's "The Checklist Manifesto" (2009)*

**When to Use**: Processes without set order | Frequently skipped steps | Common error-prone tasks

**Guidelines**: Keep small | Automate what you can | Don't overdo it

**Useful Checklists**:

1. Developer code completion ("definition of done")
2. Unit & functional testing (edge cases, unusual scenarios)
3. Software release (build/deployment steps)

**Getting Buy-In**: Explain reasoning | Collaborative creation (ownership)

**Hawthorne Effect** (*observational psychology concept*): Perception of monitoring encourages compliance - people perform better when they know they're being observed or measured

---

## Negotiation Skills

### With Business Stakeholders

- Pay attention to buzzwords/jargon (contain clues)
- Gather information before negotiating
- State things in qualified cost and time
- Divide and conquer to qualify demands

### With Other Architects

- Demonstration defeats discussion
- Avoid being overly argumentative or personal
- Calm leadership + clear reasoning wins

### With Developers

- Provide justification (not dictates)
- Have them arrive at the solution themselves

---

## Integrating with Development Teams

### Control Your Calendar

**Meetings Imposed on You**:
- Ask why you're needed
- Attend only for relevant topics
- Could meeting notes suffice?

**Meetings You Impose**:
- Keep to absolute minimum
- Set and stick to agenda
- Schedule at day edges (morning, after lunch, late)

### Physical Presence

**On-site**: Sit with the team | Walk around, be visible | Block time for conversations, questions, coaching

**Remote**: Use video calls effectively | Establish regular check-ins | Maintain open communication

### Respect Developer Flow State

Flow = 100% brain engagement where hours feel like minutes. Don't disrupt flow. Pay attention to team productivity patterns.

---

## Quick Reference

### ADR Template

```markdown
# [Number]. [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed/Accepted/Superseded]

**Context**: [Situation forcing this decision]

**Decision**: [We will...]

**Consequences**:
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Trade-offs]

**Compliance**: [How measured]
```

### Leadership Checklist

- [ ] Appropriate constraints (not too many/few)
- [ ] Regular collaboration with teams
- [ ] Clear business justifications for decisions
- [ ] ADRs for significant decisions
- [ ] Respect team flow and productivity
- [ ] Right-sized meetings (agenda, timing)
- [ ] Lead by example, not authority

### Team Health Indicators

**Good Signs**: Parallel work | Clear ownership | Open communication | Productive flow time

**Warning Signs**: Merge conflicts | Unclear responsibilities | Silent disagreement | Blocked progress

### The 4 Cs of Architecture Leadership

1. **Communication**: Clear, effective information sharing
2. **Collaboration**: Working together toward goals
3. **Clear**: Unambiguous direction and decisions
4. **Concise**: Direct, to-the-point guidance
