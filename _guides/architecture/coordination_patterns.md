## Overview

Coordination patterns enable multiple distributed nodes to work together effectively, ensuring consistency, preventing conflicts, and managing shared resources.

## Leader Election

**What it is:** Selects one node from a group to coordinate activities or make decisions on behalf of the group.

**Why use it:** Provides coordination, prevents conflicts, and ensures single source of truth for critical operations.

**When to use:**
- Need single coordinator for distributed operations
- Preventing duplicate processing
- Coordinating resource access
- Managing distributed state

**Example:** Cluster of background job processors electing a leader to coordinate job distribution and prevent duplicate processing.

## Distributed Lock

**What it is:** Coordinates access to shared resources across multiple distributed nodes to prevent conflicts.

**Why use it:** Prevents race conditions, ensures mutual exclusion, and coordinates resource access.

**When to use:**
- Multiple nodes might access same resource
- Need to prevent duplicate operations
- Coordinating updates to shared state

**Challenges:**
- Lock holder failure requires timeout/lease mechanism
- Network partitions can cause split-brain scenarios
- Performance impact of distributed coordination

**Example:** Multiple instances of order processing service using distributed lock to ensure only one instance processes each order.

## Consensus

**What it is:** Ensures multiple nodes agree on a value or decision, even in the presence of failures.

**Why use it:** Provides strong consistency, handles Byzantine failures, and ensures agreement in distributed systems.

**When to use:**
- Need strong consistency guarantees
- Handling mission-critical decisions
- Implementing distributed databases
- Building fault-tolerant systems

**Common algorithms:**
- **Raft:** Leader-based consensus with strong consistency
- **PBFT:** Byzantine fault tolerant consensus
- **Paxos:** Classic consensus algorithm

**Example:** Distributed database using Raft consensus to ensure all replicas agree on transaction ordering and committed state.
