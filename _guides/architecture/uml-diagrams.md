## Most Useful UML Diagrams

### 1. Class Diagrams (80% Usage)
**Purpose**: Model static structure, classes, attributes, methods, and relationships

### 2. Sequence Diagrams (70% Usage)
**Purpose**: Show how objects interact over time in specific scenarios

### 3. Use Case Diagrams (60% Usage)
**Purpose**: Capture functional requirements and user interactions

### 4. Activity Diagrams (50% Usage)
**Purpose**: Model workflows, business processes, and complex algorithms

### 5. Component Diagrams (40% Usage)

## Class Diagrams

### What They Are
Class diagrams show the static structure of a system by modeling classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.

### When to Use
- **Requirements Analysis**: Identify domain entities and their relationships
- **System Design**: Define system architecture and data models
- **Implementation**: Guide object-oriented code structure
- **Documentation**: Maintain system architecture documentation

### Key Elements
- **Classes**: Rectangles with three sections (name, attributes, methods)
- **Relationships**: Associations, inheritance, composition, aggregation
- **Multiplicity**: Number of instances in relationships
- **Visibility**: Public (+), private (-), protected (#)

### Best Practices
- Keep diagrams focused on specific subsystems
- Show only relevant attributes and methods
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Include multiplicity and relationship types

---

## Sequence Diagrams

### What They Are
Sequence diagrams show how objects interact over time, focusing on the order of message exchanges.

### When to Use
- **System Design**: Model complex interactions between components
- **API Design**: Define service interfaces and message flows
- **Testing**: Create test scenarios and verify behavior
- **Debugging**: Understand interaction flows for troubleshooting

### Key Elements
- **Actors/Objects**: Vertical lifelines showing participants
- **Messages**: Horizontal arrows showing interactions
- **Activation Boxes**: Show when objects are active
- **Return Messages**: Dashed arrows showing responses

### Example: User Authentication Flow

### Illustrations

### Best Practices
- Focus on one scenario per diagram
- Show error handling paths
- Include timing constraints when relevant
- Keep message names clear and concise

---

## Use Case Diagrams

### What They Are
Use case diagrams capture functional requirements by showing how users (actors) interact with the system.

### When to Use
- **Requirements Gathering**: Identify system functionality
- **Project Scoping**: Define system boundaries and features
- **Communication**: Share understanding with stakeholders
- **Testing**: Create acceptance criteria and test cases

### Key Elements
- **Actors**: External entities that interact with the system
- **Use Cases**: System functionality (oval shapes)
- **System Boundary**: Rectangle containing use cases
- **Relationships**: Include, extend, generalization

### Illustrations

### Best Practices
- Keep use cases at appropriate level of detail
- Focus on user goals, not system functions
- Use clear, action-oriented names
- Show primary and secondary actors

---

## Activity Diagrams

### What They Are
Activity diagrams model workflows, business processes, and complex algorithms showing the flow of activities.

### When to Use
- **Business Process Modeling**: Document existing or proposed workflows
- **Algorithm Design**: Model complex decision logic
- **Requirements Analysis**: Understand process flows
- **System Integration**: Show how different systems interact

### Key Elements
- **Activities**: Rounded rectangles showing actions
- **Decision Nodes**: Diamonds for conditional logic
- **Fork/Join**: Parallel processing flows
- **Start/End Nodes**: Initial and final states

### Best Practices
- Start with high-level activities, then refine
- Show decision points and alternative paths
- Use swimlanes for different actors/systems
- Include error handling flows

## Component Diagrams

### What They Are
Component diagrams show how a system is organized into components and their dependencies.

### When to Use
- **Architecture Design**: Define system modules and interfaces
- **Team Organization**: Assign components to development teams
- **Deployment Planning**: Understand component dependencies
- **Refactoring**: Identify coupling and cohesion issues

### Key Elements
- **Components**: Rectangles with component stereotype
- **Interfaces**: Provided and required interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Arrows showing relationships
- **Ports**: Connection points for interfaces

### Illustrations

### Best Practices
- Group related components into packages
- Show key interfaces and dependencies
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Keep component granularity consistent

## Deployment Diagrams

### What They Are
Deployment diagrams show the physical deployment of software components on hardware infrastructure.

### When to Use
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Design system deployment architecture
- **DevOps**: Plan CI/CD pipelines and environments
- **Scaling**: Understand resource requirements and bottlenecks
- **Troubleshooting**: Visualize system topology for debugging

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with high-level diagrams, then add detail
2. **Focus on Purpose**: Each diagram should have a clear objective
3. **Keep Current**: Update diagrams as system evolves
4. **Use Standards**: Follow UML conventions and notation
5. **Review Regularly**: Validate diagrams with stakeholders

### When to Create UML Diagrams

**Always Create**:
- Class diagrams for core domain models
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Use case diagrams for requirement validation

**Create When Needed**:
- Activity diagrams for complex business processes
- Component diagrams for modular architectures
- Deployment diagrams for distributed systems

**Avoid Over-Modeling**:
- Don't create diagrams for simple, well-understood concepts
- Don't try to model every detail upfront
- Focus on areas of high complexity or risk

### Integration with Development

1. **Version Control**: Store diagram sources in Git
2. **Documentation**: Include diagrams in technical documentation
3. **Code Generation**: Use tools that generate code from models
4. **Reverse Engineering**: Generate diagrams from existing code

## Quick Reference

### Tool Selection Guide
- **Developers**: PlantUML + VS Code/IntelliJ
- **Architects**: Visual Paradigm or StarUML
- **Teams**: Lucidchart or Draw.io
- **Documentation**: PlantUML (version controllable)
