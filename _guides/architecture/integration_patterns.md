## Overview

Integration patterns define how different systems and services work together, enabling data flow and coordination between disparate components.

## Pipes and Filters

**What it is:** A pattern that processes data through a series of processing steps (filters) connected by channels (pipes), where each filter transforms the data and passes it to the next stage.

**Why use it:** Promotes reusability, enables parallel processing, and allows for flexible composition of processing steps.

**When to use:**
- Data needs to pass through multiple transformation steps
- Want to reuse processing components
- Need to enable parallel processing
- Building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for interactive applications requiring low latency
- Cannot handle transactions across multiple filters
- Debugging can be complex in long pipelines

**Example:** Image processing pipeline where an uploaded image passes through filters for resizing, watermarking, format conversion, and thumbnail generation.

## Scatter-Gather

**What it is:** A pattern that sends a request to multiple services in parallel and aggregates their responses into a single result.

**Why use it:** Reduces overall response time by parallelizing requests and enables querying multiple data sources simultaneously.

**When to use:**
- Need to query multiple services for complete information
- Can benefit from parallel processing
- Partial results are acceptable if some services are unavailable

**Considerations:**
- Overall response time limited by the slowest service
- Need to handle partial failures gracefully
- May require result aggregation and deduplication

**Example:** Travel booking system that simultaneously queries multiple airlines, hotels, and car rental services to provide comprehensive search results.

## Content-Based Router

**What it is:** Routes messages to different destinations based on message content rather than a predetermined path.

**Why use it:** Enables dynamic routing decisions and supports complex business rules for message distribution.

**When to use:**
- Routing decisions depend on message content
- Need flexible, rule-based message distribution
- Different message types require different processing

**Example:** Order processing system that routes high-value orders to manual review, standard orders to automatic processing, and international orders to compliance checking.

## Message Translator

**What it is:** Transforms message format or content to enable communication between systems that use different data formats.

**Why use it:** Enables integration between systems with incompatible data formats without modifying the systems themselves.

**When to use:**
- Integrating legacy systems with modern applications
- Systems use different data formats or protocols
- Need to maintain backward compatibility

**Example:** Integrating a modern REST API with a legacy SOAP service by translating JSON requests to XML and XML responses back to JSON.
