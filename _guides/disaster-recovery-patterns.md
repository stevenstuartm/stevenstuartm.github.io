## Overview

Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies define how organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events that could affect business operations. These patterns provide different levels of protection, recovery speed, and cost considerations to match various business continuity requirements.

**Disaster Types:**
- **Natural Disasters**: Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, fires
- **Technical Failures**: Hardware failures, software bugs, network outages
- **Human Actions**: Accidental deletions, malicious attacks, operational errors
- **Regional Outages**: Data center failures, power grid issues, ISP problems

## Key Concepts

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
RPO measures the maximum age of files that an organization must recover from backup storage for normal operations to resume after a disaster. In other words, it determines how much data an organization can afford to lose.

- **Example**: RPO of 1 hour means accepting up to 1 hour of data loss
- **Typical Ranges**: Minutes to hours for critical systems, hours to days for less critical systems

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
RTO measures the targeted duration within which a business process must be restored after a disaster to avoid unacceptable consequences. It determines how long an organization can afford to be down.

- **Example**: RTO of 2 hours means systems must be restored within 2 hours
- **Typical Ranges**: Minutes for mission-critical systems, hours to days for others

### Business Impact Analysis
A study determining how important a system is to day-to-day business operations, answering:
- How much money would be lost from downtime?
- Would company reputation suffer?  
- How much capital should be invested in DR?
- What are the regulatory compliance requirements?

## Backup and Restore

The most basic DR strategy involves creating backups of data and systems that can be restored when needed. This approach offers the highest RPO but lowest cost and complexity.

### How It Works
1. **Regular Backups**: Automated snapshots of data, configurations, and system images
2. **Offsite Storage**: Backups stored in different geographic locations
3. **Restore Process**: Provision new infrastructure and restore from backups during disaster
4. **Testing**: Regular validation that backups can be successfully restored

### Implementation Components
- **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**: Pre-configured server snapshots
- **Database Snapshots**: Point-in-time copies of database state
- **Cloud Storage Sync**: Services like AWS Storage Gateway, S3 cross-region replication
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation, Terraform templates for environment recreation

### Advantages
- **Lowest Cost**: Minimal ongoing infrastructure investment
- **Simple Implementation**: Well-understood backup and restore processes
- **Wide Applicability**: Suitable for all types of data and applications
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets basic data retention requirements

### Disadvantages
- **High RPO**: Potential for significant data loss (hours to days)
- **High RTO**: Long recovery times due to infrastructure provisioning
- **Manual Intensive**: Often requires significant manual intervention
- **Testing Overhead**: Regular restore testing required but often neglected

### Typical Metrics
- **RPO**: 8-24 hours
- **RTO**: 4-24+ hours
- **Cost**: Lowest operational expense

### When to Use
- Non-critical systems where extended downtime is acceptable
- "Cold" or archived data that changes infrequently
- Budget-constrained environments
- Initial DR implementation as foundation for more advanced strategies

## Pilot Light

For critical core data and services. The backups are provisioned but not running until needed. Pilot light involves maintaining a minimal version of an application infrastructure in the cloud that can be rapidly scaled up in the event of a disaster.

### How It Works
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Essential components always running (databases, key services)
2. **Dormant Resources**: Application servers and non-core components shut down
3. **Data Replication**: Continuous or near-continuous data synchronization
4. **Activation Process**: Scale up dormant resources when disaster strikes
5. **Traffic Switching**: Route users to scaled-up environment

### Key Characteristics
- **Always-On Core**: Critical data stores remain active and synchronized
- **Shut-Off Compute**: Application servers are not deployed (zero instances)
- **Separate Region**: Located in different geographic region from primary
- **Quick Scaling**: Use AMIs and Auto Scaling to rapidly provision resources

### Infrastructure Components
- **Data Layer**: Amazon RDS cross-region read replicas, DynamoDB Global Tables
- **Storage**: S3 cross-region replication, EBS snapshots
- **Network**: VPC, subnets, security groups pre-configured
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancers configured but not receiving traffic
- **Auto Scaling**: Groups configured with zero instances

### Advantages
- **Cost Effective**: Only pay for minimal running infrastructure
- **Faster than Backup/Restore**: Core systems already provisioned
- **Data Protection**: Continuous replication protects against data loss
- **Scalable**: Can quickly scale to match production capacity

### Disadvantages
- **Manual Activation**: Requires human intervention to scale up
- **Testing Complexity**: Harder to test without full activation
- **Database Failover**: May involve promoting read replicas (with downtime)
- **Application Dependencies**: Must ensure all dependencies can be quickly provisioned

### Typical Metrics
- **RPO**: 15 minutes to 1 hour (based on replication frequency)
- **RTO**: 30 minutes to 1 hour (infrastructure scaling time)
- **Cost**: Low to medium ongoing expense

### Scaling Process
1. **Detection**: Automated or manual disaster detection
2. **Database Promotion**: Convert read replicas to primary databases
3. **Instance Deployment**: Launch EC2 instances from pre-configured AMIs
4. **Auto Scaling**: Scale out application tiers to production capacity
5. **Load Balancer Update**: Begin routing traffic to recovery region
6. **DNS Update**: Point domain names to recovery environment

### When to Use
- Business-critical applications requiring faster recovery than backup/restore
- Systems with acceptable brief downtime during scaling process
- Organizations wanting balance between cost and recovery speed
- Applications with clear separation between data and compute tiers

## Warm Standby

A scaled-down version of a fully functional environment. This smaller, but always-on, environment can be quickly scaled up to handle production loads during a disaster. Warm standby involves ensuring that there is a scaled down, but fully functional, copy of your production environment in another Region.

### How It Works
1. **Functional Stack**: Complete application stack running at reduced capacity
2. **Live Traffic Handling**: Can immediately serve requests, though at limited scale
3. **Continuous Replication**: Real-time data synchronization from production
4. **Scaling Process**: Increase capacity rather than deploying new infrastructure
5. **Failover**: Quick traffic switching with minimal downtime

### Key Characteristics
- **Always Functional**: Unlike pilot light, can handle traffic immediately
- **Reduced Capacity**: Typically 20-50% of production capacity
- **Fully Deployed**: All application components running
- **Separate Region**: Geographic separation for true disaster protection

### Infrastructure Components
- **Compute**: EC2 instances running but at smaller scale (e.g., 1 per tier)
- **Databases**: Synchronized read replicas or secondary databases
- **Load Balancers**: Active and health-checking warm standby instances
- **Auto Scaling**: Configured to rapidly scale up when needed
- **Monitoring**: Full observability stack monitoring warm standby health

### Advantages
- **Immediate Availability**: Can handle traffic at reduced capacity immediately
- **Lower RTO**: Faster recovery than pilot light (only scaling, no deployment)
- **Easy Testing**: Can test with synthetic transactions before failover
- **Partial Capacity**: Provides service continuity even before full scaling

### Disadvantages
- **Higher Cost**: Running infrastructure continuously increases expense
- **Resource Management**: Must maintain and update two environments
- **Scaling Required**: Still needs scaling process to handle full production load
- **Database Synchronization**: Complex database failover procedures

### Typical Metrics
- **RPO**: 5-15 minutes (based on replication lag)
- **RTO**: 5-30 minutes (scaling time only)
- **Cost**: Medium ongoing operational expense

### The key difference between warm standby and pilot light:
- **Pilot Light**: Cannot handle production traffic without initial action (turning on servers)
- **Warm Standby**: Can immediately handle traffic at reduced capacity

### When to Use
- Applications requiring minimal downtime and fast recovery
- Systems where partial capacity is acceptable during recovery
- Organizations with moderate DR budget
- Applications with predictable scaling patterns

## Multi-Site Hot-Site

Multi-site active/active is the most robust and costly disaster recovery strategy. It involves creating parallel infrastructure and data stores that are continuously kept in sync with production and can take over immediately during a disaster.

### How It Works
1. **Parallel Production**: Full-scale production environment in multiple regions
2. **Active/Active**: Both sites serve production traffic simultaneously
3. **Real-Time Sync**: Continuous data replication between sites
4. **Automatic Failover**: Instant traffic redistribution during outages
5. **Load Distribution**: Normal operations use both sites for capacity

### Key Characteristics
- **Full Capacity**: Each site capable of handling complete production load
- **Zero Downtime**: Immediate failover with no service interruption
- **Global Distribution**: Sites in different geographic regions
- **Automatic Recovery**: Minimal human intervention required

### Infrastructure Components
- **Compute**: Full production capacity in multiple regions
- **Databases**: Multi-region databases with automatic failover
- **Global Load Balancers**: Route 53, Global Accelerator for traffic distribution
- **Data Replication**: Synchronous or near-synchronous replication
- **Monitoring**: Global monitoring and alerting systems

### Advantages
- **Near-Zero RTO**: Almost instantaneous failover capabilities
- **Near-Zero RPO**: Minimal data loss with synchronous replication
- **Business Continuity**: Uninterrupted service during disasters
- **Performance**: Global presence improves user experience

### Disadvantages
- **Highest Cost**: Double (or more) infrastructure investment
- **Complexity**: Most complex to design, implement, and maintain
- **Data Consistency**: Complex distributed database challenges
- **Over-Engineering**: May be excessive for many business requirements

### Typical Metrics
- **RPO**: Near-zero to 5 minutes
- **RTO**: Near-zero to 5 minutes  
- **Cost**: Highest ongoing operational expense

### Implementation Patterns
- **Active/Active**: Traffic distributed across multiple sites
- **Active/Passive**: One site primary, others ready for immediate takeover
- **Regional Distribution**: Sites in different continents for global coverage

### When to Use
- Mission-critical systems where any downtime is unacceptable
- Financial services, healthcare, emergency services
- Applications with global user base requiring low latency
- Organizations with substantial DR budgets and requirements
