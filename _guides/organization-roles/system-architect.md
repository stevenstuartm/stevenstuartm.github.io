category: Organization & Roles
---

## Role Purpose
The System Architect serves as the organization's technical visionary and strategic technology leader, responsible for defining and evolving the software and cloud infrastructure architecture strategy, ensuring technical excellence across software development and cloud production infrastructure, and aligning technology decisions with business objectives.

---

## Strategic Responsibilities

### 1. Architecture Vision & Strategy
- Define and maintain the software and cloud architecture roadmap aligned with business strategy
- Establish architectural principles, standards, and governance frameworks for software systems
- Evaluate cloud technologies relevant to current architectural challenges and strategic initiatives
- Make major technical decisions regarding software and cloud infrastructure systems

### 2. Business & Technology Alignment
- Translate business requirements into scalable technical strategies
- Develop TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) and ROI analyses for major technology initiatives
- Communicate technical strategy and trade-offs to stakeholders
- Collaborate with development teams to ensure alignment between architecture vision and implementation

### 3. Cloud & Infrastructure Strategy
- Design and evolve cloud architecture strategy (multi-cloud, multi-region, optimization)
- Collaborate on cloud governance, security, and compliance frameworks
- Own the cloud cost optimization strategy with quarterly business reviews
- Define disaster recovery, business continuity, and resilience strategies

## Technical Leadership Responsibilities

### 4. System Architecture & Design
- Design and oversee implementation of complex, distributed software systems
- Provide guidance on high-impact architectural decisions across software and data systems
- Define integration patterns and API strategies for internal and external systems
- Establish observability, monitoring, and operational excellence standards for cloud infrastructure
- Lead proof-of-concept initiatives for strategic technology evaluations
- Collaborate on data warehouse and reporting strategies and practices

### 5. Technical Excellence & Innovation
- Champion engineering best practices (DevOps, security-first development)
- Research and introduce innovative solutions to complex technical challenges
- Mentor senior engineers and technical leads on development teams
- Foster a culture of technical excellence and continuous improvement
- Work closely with development teams to solve complex technical problems

### 6. Platform & DevOps Collaboration
- Collaborate with development teams on CI/CD strategy and deployment pipeline architecture
- Review and provide guidance on infrastructure-as-code standards and practices
- Collaborate on strategy for development tooling and platforms
- Provide guidance on source control and deployment strategies
- Collaborate on incident response frameworks and post-mortem processes

---

## Operational & Management Responsibilities

### 7. System Operations & Reliability
- Review system performance metrics and drive optimization initiatives for cloud infrastructure
- Oversee post-incident analysis processes and identify systemic improvements
- Establish capacity planning and scaling strategies for cloud-based software applications and infrastructure

### 8. Team Development & Knowledge Management
- Oversee the development of architecture practices within engineering teams
- Create and maintain high-level architectural documentation
- Mentor senior engineers and technical leads on architectural patterns and best practices
- Document and communicate architectural decisions and patterns across development and data teams

## Role Flexibility & Development Contributions

While the System Architect role is primarily focused on strategic architecture and technical leadership, the nature of software development teams requires flexibility in practice. 

### Hands-On Development Work
This role may involve daily software development activities when:
- **Staff availability requires it** - Team capacity constraints or critical skill gaps may necessitate direct development contributions
- **Project delivery demands it** - Sprint commitments, release deadlines, or customer-critical features may require all hands on deck
- **Technical complexity requires it** - Certain technical challenges may be best addressed through direct implementation

### Priority Considerations
The organization recognizes that as a team effort, there will be periods where:
- **Product quality and delivery take precedence** over architectural planning and oversight activities
- **Immediate development needs** may temporarily supersede longer-term strategic architecture work
- **Collaborative delivery** requires the System Architect to function as a senior development team member

This flexibility is expected and understood as part of the role. The System Architect should balance strategic responsibilities with pragmatic team needs, shifting focus as project demands and team capacity require. The ability to context-switch between strategic architecture work and hands-on development is considered a strength of this role.

## Success Metrics

Success in this role is measured through both ongoing operational excellence and project-specific outcomes:

### Ongoing Operational Metrics
- **Cloud cost management**: Continuous monitoring and optimization of cloud infrastructure spend
- **System uptime and reliability**: Maintaining agreed-upon SLA/SLO targets for software and cloud infrastructure
- **Technical debt reduction**: Progressive improvement in software system maintainability and code quality
- **Development team effectiveness**: Team velocity and satisfaction with architectural support

### Project & Quarterly Goal Metrics
Success metrics will be defined contextually based on:
- Specific architectural initiatives and their business objectives
- Quarterly OKRs aligned with organizational priorities
- Migration projects (timelines, success criteria, rollback safety)
- Technology evaluation and adoption outcomes
- Performance optimization targets for specific systems
