## 1. Core Definitions and Concepts

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

**Simple analogy**: Think of AI as giving computers the ability to "think" and make decisions like humans do, but using mathematical calculations instead of biological processes.

### Machine Learning (ML)
The use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.

**Key insight**: Instead of programming every possible scenario (traditional programming), ML lets computers learn patterns from examples and make predictions about new, unseen data. Like teaching a child to recognize cats by showing them many cat pictures, rather than describing every possible cat feature.

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks (called deep neural networks) to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Particularly effective for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

**Architecture concept**: "Deep" refers to multiple layers (often 10-100+ layers) where each layer processes and transforms information before passing it to the next layer, similar to how human brain processes information through multiple stages.

### Neural Networks
Machine learning programs that make decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, using processes that mimic how biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options, and arrive at conclusions.

**Basic structure**: Consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) that receive inputs, apply mathematical transformations, and pass outputs to other nodes. The "learning" happens by adjusting the strength of connections between neurons based on training data.

### AI Classification by Capability

#### Applied ("Weak") AI
- **Definition**: AI tailored for specific tasks with human-level or superior performance in dedicated domains
- **Goal**: Address real-world problems by creating AI solutions for specific sector challenges
- **Examples**: Image recognition systems, recommendation engines, chatbots

#### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- **Definition**: AI systems with general-purpose intelligence comparable to (or beyond) human cognitive abilities
- **Status**: Emerging field focused on building "thinking machines"
- **Timeline**: Still theoretical, with significant research ongoing

### Explainability and Transparency

#### Black Box Models
- **Definition**: ML models that provide results without explaining their decision-making process
- **Characteristics**: Internal processes and weighted factors remain unknown, lacking transparency
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a doctor giving you a diagnosis without explaining their reasoning - you get the answer but don't understand how they arrived at it
- **Challenge**: Growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) in regulated industries where decisions must be justified

#### Explainable AI (XAI)
- **Purpose**: Make ML models interpretable and understandable to humans
- **Why it matters**: Builds trust, enables debugging, meets regulatory requirements, and helps identify model biases
- **Methods**: Feature importance scores, decision trees, attention mechanisms, simplified explanations
- **Trend**: Major focus area for 2025, especially in finance, healthcare, and legal applications where "black box" decisions can have serious consequences

## 3. Model Training Fundamentals

### Training Dataset Components

#### Features
- **Definition**: Input dimensions that describe characteristics of training data
- **Simple explanation**: The "ingredients" or attributes you feed into the model to help it learn patterns
- **Role**: Individual measurable properties of observed objects (height, weight, color, price, etc.)
- **Quality matters**: The choice of meaningful, distinguishable, and independent features is fundamental to efficient ML algorithms
- **Example**: For predicting house prices, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, age of house

#### Labels
- **Definition**: Ground truth data that output is compared against - the "correct answers" during training
- **Purpose**: Show the ML model what the desired response should be for each example
- **Process**: Data labeling (annotation) requires human experts to provide correct answers, often expensive and time-consuming
- **Training relationship**: Model learns by comparing its predictions to these labels and adjusting to minimize errors
- **Example**: Feature = image of a bird; Label = "robin" (the correct species name the model should predict)

### Training Process Phases

#### 1. Model Training
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying generalizations in data
- **Prediction Generation**: Creating predictive capabilities
- **Optimization**: Improving performance through iterative adjustments

#### 2. Inference
- **Deployment**: Can be performed on any device with the trained model
- **Production Use**: Real-world application of learned patterns

### Common Training Problems

#### Under-fitting
- **Symptom**: Model works poorly on both training data and new data - it hasn't learned enough
- **Visualization**: Creates overly simple relationships (like a straight line) that miss important patterns in the data
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a student who barely studied for a test - they perform poorly on practice problems and the actual exam
- **Causes**:
  - Model too simple for the data complexity (using linear model for curved relationships)
  - Insufficient or poor-quality training examples
  - Not enough training time or iterations

#### Over-fitting
- **Symptom**: Model performs excellently on training data but poorly on new, unseen data - it memorized instead of learned
- **Real-world analogy**: Like a student who memorized practice test answers but can't solve similar problems with different numbers
- **Cause**: Model captures noise and specific details of training data rather than general patterns
- **Visual**: Creates overly complex decision boundaries that perfectly fit training data but fail to generalize
- **Solutions**:
  - Increase training data size and diversity
  - Reduce model complexity (fewer parameters/layers)
  - Apply regularization techniques (penalties for complexity)
  - Use cross-validation to detect overfitting early

### Modern Training Enhancements

#### Automated Feature Engineering
- **Purpose**: Automatically discover and create relevant features from raw data
- **Benefit**: Reduces manual effort and potentially discovers hidden patterns
- **Tools**: AutoML platforms increasingly include this capability

#### Continuous Training

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)

### Overview
- **Method**: Agent (the learner) interacts with an environment to achieve specific goals, learning from trial and error
- **Learning process**: Like training a pet with treats and corrections - the agent tries actions, receives feedback (rewards/penalties), and learns to maximize rewards
- **Feedback mechanism**: Instead of being told the right answer, the agent discovers it through experimentation
- **Key insight**: Learns optimal behavior through experience, not from examples of correct behavior
- **Time dimension**: Actions have consequences that unfold over time, requiring long-term strategic thinking

### Core Components
- **Decision-Making Agent**: The learning entity taking actions
