## Composition Over Inheritance
- **Prefer**: Dependency injection and composition
- **Avoid**: Deep inheritance hierarchies
- **Benefits**: More flexible, testable, and maintainable

## Dependency Injection
- **Constructor Injection**: Primary method for required dependencies
- **Property Injection**: For optional dependencies
- **Method Injection**: For contextual dependencies

## Clean Code Principles

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid over-engineering
- Prefer readable code over clever code

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
- Don't implement features before they're needed
- Focus on current requirements
- Avoid speculative generality

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Eliminate code duplication through abstraction
- Use shared libraries and utilities
- Balance with single responsibility principle

## Testing Considerations
- **Testability**: SOLID principles improve unit testing
- **Mocking**: Interfaces enable effective mocking
- **Isolation**: Single responsibility makes components easier to test
