## Hi, I'm Steven

I'm a software architect who's spent 15+ years building cloud-native platforms, distributed systems, and scalable architectures. I focus on solving real problems with pragmatic solutions—cutting costs, improving security, and helping teams ship reliable software.

### What I Do

I design modern cloud architectures, mentor developers, and help teams balance velocity with stability. My stack centers on .NET and cloud technologies, with experience across financial services, digital banking, and SaaS.

I believe good architecture is about thoughtful tradeoffs—building systems that evolve with your business while keeping security and performance as first-class citizens.

### This Blog

I write about software architecture, cloud systems, and lessons learned from building and modernizing platforms. Topics include system design patterns, AWS and .NET practices, microservices, DevOps, and engineering leadership.
