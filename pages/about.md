## Hi, I'm Steven

![Steven Stuart - Software Architect specializing in cloud-native platforms and distributed systems](/assets/img/profile-steven-stuart.jpeg){: .profile-image}

I'm a software architect with 15+ years designing and building cloud-native platforms, distributed systems, and scalable solutions. I specialize in pragmatic architecture that delivers measurable results: reduced costs, enhanced security, and systems that teams can confidently maintain and evolve.

### What I Do

**Architecture & Design** — I design cloud-based systems on AWS, focusing on resilience, security, and cost optimization. From migrating monoliths to microservices to implementing event-driven architectures, I help organizations make smart technical decisions.

**Technical Leadership** — I mentor developers, establish best practices, and guide teams through architectural transitions. I believe great architecture requires collaboration between business goals and technical reality.

**Technology Stack** — .NET (C#), AWS (EKS, Lambda, Aurora, DynamoDB), GraphQL, Vue.js, and modern DevOps practices. I've worked across financial services, digital banking, and SaaS platforms.

### Philosophy

Good architecture balances tradeoffs: performance vs. complexity, flexibility vs. simplicity, velocity vs. stability. I prioritize evolutionary design—systems that adapt as your business grows while maintaining security and performance.
