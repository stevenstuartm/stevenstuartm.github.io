## Hi, I'm Steven

![Steven Stuart - Software Architect specializing in cloud-native platforms and distributed systems](/assets/img/profile-steven-stuart.jpeg){: .profile-image}

I'm a software architect with 15+ years designing and building cloud-native platforms, distributed systems, and scalable solutions. I specialize in pragmatic architecture that delivers measurable results: reduced costs, enhanced security, and systems that teams can confidently maintain and evolve.

I believe architecture starts with human connection, thrives on genuine commitment, and succeeds by honoring agreements. Good architecture balances technical tradeoffs. Great solutions start with trust and maintain that trust through principled execution.

### What I Do

**Architecture & Design** — I design cloud-based systems on AWS, focusing on resilience, security, and cost optimization. From migrating monoliths to microservices to implementing event-driven architectures, I help organizations make smart technical decisions. But first, I invest time understanding the people behind the problems - their needs, constraints, and context. Technical elegance means nothing if it doesn't solve the real problem.

**Technical Leadership** — I mentor developers, establish best practices, and guide teams through architectural transitions. Great architecture requires more than technical skill - it requires building trust, securing genuine commitment from stakeholders and teams, and maintaining that alignment throughout delivery. I don't just hand down designs; I collaborate to create solutions people believe in.

**Technology Stack** — .NET (C#), AWS (EKS, Lambda, Aurora, DynamoDB), GraphQL, Vue.js, and modern DevOps practices. I've worked across financial services, digital banking, and SaaS platforms.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow engineers, architects, and technical leaders. Whether you want to discuss architecture patterns, share experiences, or explore collaboration opportunities, I'd love to hear from you.

### Arash Didehbani {% include linkedin-link.html url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arash-didehbani-229442b7/" %}
*Staff Software Engineer - Tech Lead*

"Steven is the employee every company wishes they had. When faced with difficult tasks or issues he is the go to for quick and precise solution. He is not only your best coder, he is also your architect. He approaches every coding challenge with the goal of never having to modify the code again. Building Configurable systems is his biggest strength. He takes a specific requirement for a 'Right Now' implementation and turns it into a generic adaptable solution. He makes all future coding for other developers a breeze. He tries very hard sticking to SOLID principles as long as it does not compromise the performance of a system. He constantly hungers for new challenges. I have worked with him for over 7 years and hope to continue working with him in the future."

"Steven is a great person to work with. He has an understanding of the big picture that is astounding. He is as capable of point the way for resources that need guidance and he is rolling up his sleeves and getting a task complete himself. The balance between intellectual theory and practical application is not easy to maintain, but Steven makes it look easy. I enjoyed working with Steven and hope to have to opportunity again soon."
