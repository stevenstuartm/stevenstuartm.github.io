## Hi, I'm Steven

![Steven Stuart - Software Architect specializing in cloud-native platforms and distributed systems](/assets/img/profile-steven-stuart.jpeg){: .profile-image}

I'm a software architect with 15+ years designing and building cloud-native platforms, distributed systems, and scalable solutions. I specialize in pragmatic architecture that delivers measurable results: reduced costs, enhanced security, and systems that teams can confidently maintain and evolve.

### What I Do

**Architecture & Design** — I design cloud-based systems on AWS, focusing on resilience, security, and cost optimization. From migrating monoliths to microservices to implementing event-driven architectures, I help organizations make smart technical decisions.

**Technical Leadership** — I mentor developers, establish best practices, and guide teams through architectural transitions. I believe great architecture requires collaboration between business goals and technical reality.

**Technology Stack** — .NET (C#), AWS (EKS, Lambda, Aurora, DynamoDB), GraphQL, Vue.js, and modern DevOps practices. I've worked across financial services, digital banking, and SaaS platforms.

### Philosophy

Good architecture balances tradeoffs: performance vs. complexity, flexibility vs. simplicity, velocity vs. stability. I prioritize evolutionary design—systems that adapt as your business grows while maintaining security and performance.

### This Site

This site is my platform for sharing knowledge and experience across multiple formats:

**Blog** — Insights from real projects: architectural patterns, cloud optimization strategies, Domain-Driven Design in practice, and engineering leadership lessons learned from production systems.

**Study Guides** — Comprehensive reference materials and collected notes on software fundamentals.

**Tech Radar** — My current technology landscape showing what tools and practices I'm actively using (Adopt), experimenting with (Trial), evaluating (Assess), or moving away from (Hold).

Whether you're building production systems, preparing for technical interviews, or growing as an architect, you'll find practical, battle-tested knowledge here.
